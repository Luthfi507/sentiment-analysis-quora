"Beside being a yappy left leaning app, it used to be good. Now it doesn't load comments and fairly sucks with each update worse!!!",negative
"This is one of the best apps i've ever used in my entire life! Most Quorans are pretty good at advising, informative and still funny. Plus addicting too.üëÖ",positive
"After the recent update the feeds are not loading completely.. we have to click'more stories' all the time, which gives you nothing but the same number of feeds, nothing new.",negative
"The Quora as a social network is great,but the app is terrible,buggy,slow loading,tends to stop working,especially in the last time,I can't even see my questions...this app needs full remake.",negative
"Please improve the user experience. It's pretty horrible. The feed is filled with tonnes of questions I don't have any interest in answering and also with questions I have no interest in. The algorithm should be improved. Not just that, there are glitches in the app, whenever you click a topic on the topic navigation bar, it lands you on some other topic from it. Fix this ASAP. Please. The writers community is good though.",negative
"I like this app, but after the new update, the 'More Stories' doesn't work. It takes me back up instead of showing more. Pls fix this",negative
"I think it is the latest update causing so many bugs like the feed is not getting populated by more than 3 questions. View more is not working, unable to follow a person etc. I am not even able to follow a question..",negative
If i can only see 3 questions in my feed and after clicking more stories i am getting the same 3 questions even having speed upto 200kbps i don't even know why should i use this app anymore at least let us use the website for longer durations,negative
"Very useful application. Always get required information, a big thumbüëç for that. If creator can improve its user interface more attractive then it will rock.",positive
"I like Quora and I used to like this app. One thing I never liked was that if you navigate away, you can't get back to where you were. Now I get pop up offers that take me away and can't be closed so I can never get back to what I was reading.",negative
"This new update really sucks. It doesn't allow me to even upvote answers peacefully. I can't able to submit my answers after hours of spending time in writing. It shows error saving drafts. I had a first thought because of poor internet connection but, when I tried submitting on website, it did responded and submitted with in seconds. Please fix this issue. Because everyone loves Quora information hub. Make it as a simple and proper app to utilise.",negative
Forced Me to download the app! Reading disabled in web browser beyond a certain length of a stupid half of the answer!,negative
Can't upvote an answer. Auto refresh isn't working. Installed app again. Now can't even sign in,negative
Was good until a few days back. Now it has started to suck after the update. Couldn't load new feeds. Hope the team handles this issue as soon as possible.,negative
New version is so bad. The view more option is not working. I am able to read only three to four answers of a question not all the answers unlike previously.,negative
I cannot log in to my quota account through this app. Whenever I try it says unable to reach the server.,negative
Why so large font when I open? Also even if my net speed is high images does not load! I am getting tired if these things,negative
It is like i never thought i would be spending so much time on it. But yes i got addicted to it like anything and keep on reading in my leisure time. Never thought of this. Thanks,positive
Quality of quora has exponentially deteriorated. The feed is cluttered and the settings to influence the content on feed is not easily Accessible. I am close to uninstalling it.,negative
"After the new update, I am able to see only maximum of 3 post and on clicking more stories nothing comes up except the same 3 stories, not able to comment or upvote as well and also not able to view all answers to a question so I decided to uninstall and then reinstall it but now it is not even getting reinstalled",negative
The latest update sucks. It's not user friendly. Fix the bug at the earliest.,negative
I can get lost in Quoras interesting answers. Its like my own informative magazine. Pick a subject and then read a variety of answers. If I'm in need of a quick answer to something all I need to do is ask! I love it!,positive
"I will give it five stars but please fix the bug this is a great app. Now I can't see comments, can't upload photos or videos and can't submit answers and comments too.",negative
"I cannot comment because it asks for email verification and the link they provide in email doesn't work . Very irritating. And also I couldn't find any of my bookmarked answers , what's happening with this app ??",negative
"Got blocked on their website by a full screen dialog without the close button, so that I will have no choice but to download this app. How on Earth in 2018 does one think that a user has to be forced to take an action. Whoever took that decision, know that it's not clever, it's not by suppressing freedom that you're going to get more users, which are leaving by the way because of unbearable ads!",negative
Forces you to download the app instead of reading it in chrome. Big fail.,negative
"I love reading & I love quora. This is the best app for readers and who wants to share their knowledge, I like that feature. Spread The Precious Knowledge....",positive
The website version is much better Atleast I can see a glance of the topic and won't need to load it individually from the current page in the website version.,positive
"Have used this app for years. On the technical side, I can't think of any flaws. On the cosmetic /layout side, well, the ad display method really subtracts from its core integrity. For example, when reading questions and answers you will see advertisements 'scattered', in not so obvious ways, places, amongst the answer columns. I've had to be mindful, on a number of occasions, to be careful not to mistake the beginning of an ad for either another answer or, less frequently, the continuation of an answer in reading. It would be worth it, for users and Quora, to offer low price adfree app.",negative
It's fantastic way to interact with number of genius people around the globe. It's the platforms where one can ask questions and surely can get answers.,positive
Its great to read articles at quora and to learn about different experiences of people which also helps us evolve and keeps us engaged into good deeds,positive
App is useless. Zero configuration. Practically unreadable. Better in browser but that is blocked. Quora only viable in PC browser.,negative
Horrible app. The fact that I cannot read on mobile on the website anymore ticks me off. You'd have to pay me to download this horrid app. Killing the website go download a half assed app,negative
Very good and informative app. Helps you learn more about your interests.,positive
"App is worst. While reading the article and if I got a call or opened WhatsApp, whatever article displayed gets disappeared and starts from first, which is irritating. Everytime I can't bookmark it to read it back after a call. Samewise to clicking those news links.",negative
It's a good app. I use it as an experience reader. I keep it always in my fon. üòäüòä,positive
Definately biased towards non leftist content. It's got some interesting questions & answers. Many could be answered with internet search.,positive
"Lets me learn about the topics I find interesting and relevant, from people who actually know hands-on about the subject.",positive
"I love Quora, but I don't really like the app. I wish Quora would just let me use the web view to read and answer questions till my heart is content, but no, users are forced to download the app. The app isn't as user friendly as it can be. Commenting on people's answers & remaining on a question can sometimes be a pain. I rate it 4 stars because I love Quora. If I were to rate the app alone, it'll be 2 stars",negative
I love this app. It gives great advice from others who can help you get through whatever you're going through. That's what it's all about.,positive
"It is a great app to share ideas and knowledge, and/or just learn a thing or two about your favorite topics.",positive
I think this app could rectify your thoughts by clarifying it with the people. Good app but need some improvisations to make it user friendly,positive
"I like it. But I'm not bothered about using it to connect on social networks. For me it's great because I'm after different perspectives, so it ticks all the boxes in that way.",positive
I don't what happened with app..Every time I open it I find a blank screen and even after waiting for 2 min or so it's still not opening. When writing answer I don't where my entire written answer goes and have to retype it again and again..It's really frustrating at times..,negative
"A bit slower than reading by web browser. I prefer the web, but the app download suggestion always pop up and block all my screen, so I have no choice but to install this app.",negative
It has its ups and downs. Definitely a major leftist slant issue. Very few diverse opinions.,negative
A great way to spend a lot of time. Would be much better however if it allow users to cross post their own content to wordpress.,positive
It sucks that I can't just read a feed without your app begging me to rate it. Other than that it only average sucks. Much easier to read it in the browser.,negative
It's a good app where you will find answers of various questions. you can ask questions. you can give answer. It's a fine app.,positive
"It's ok to just read whats going on but when it comes to typing an answer it's best to do it on a desktop or laptop. When typing you only get half a screen to view. The tgping is clche and buggy, uploading and image and position is rubbish. If you want to highlight a word in bold you have do this 4-5 times before it works.",negative
Great app!! Access to great information and helps you to stay connected with society!!,positive
I LOVE this app! It's so fun to read the various questions people have and to read other people's perspective on these questions. Some answers become interesting stories while others are witty or helpful. Definitely recommend people to download it,positive
One of the best application which provides you the best information about each and every query you have .,positive
Would be alot better if it had country or hemisphere options. It's really frustrating filtering through broken English answers.,negative
"Like the idea of Quora but not liking this spyware app.The Quora website has deliberately painful functionality (e.g. when editing an article) to ""encourage"" you to get the app - and they really keep bugging you about it. Why?! Is it because the App forces you to use their own browser, no doubt tracking your every move ! Looking at their javascript linkage on their website, they're probably also after your Facebook info!",negative
"This is the best place to learn just about anything. I love it, the banter between oppositions can get quite entertaining at times. But its always appropriate and usually respectful.",positive
"Just like Google in one big community!! Love that you get free advice from doctors or someone with experience in a certain field but it's kind of a hit or miss, maybe they'll answer you, maybe not. Might have to wait 2 minutes, 2 days, 2 weeks for an answer, but I really enjoy it!!",positive
It's really a good app for students who are willing to learn new things and acquiring knowledge.It has got some issues but it's purpose has been always aplauded,positive
"This app is not running on my Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) while other apps are running smoothly. Shows ""Can't connect to the internet"" but internet connection is all okay.",negative
"Very useful. People can ask and learn new stuff every day without getting laughed at any question they ask. You get answers on your given question from experienced folks on any topic you are interested in. You can also post answers on questions from subjects you are familiar with. It's simply a social media for those who want knowledge, I love it.",positive
Worst update.. can't even see the post in my feed. You guys made important topics icon too big. My half screen occupied by that only. Thanks for the worst update. Good bye. Will come back when you sorted out. App deleted,negative
"not enough people use this app to get many interesting discussions, there are plenty of lame questions; also, bookmarks are almost impossible to find on this app",negative
I'm installing this app so I could rate it one star. Force me to download this app and take my feed away. Impossible to read your feed via web browser without uncloseable notification.,negative
Amazing app for doubt clarifying. Quora is also an infinite source of questions for students also. It has helped me a lot throughout all these years. Thank you team Quora.. Keep up the good work üëèüëèüëèüëè,positive
"I am giving this 1 star because I was forced to download it if I wanted to read anymore of the story and questions. I might have chosen to on my own, but being forces to by an uncloseable popup that completely blocks your ability to navigate through the website. I am now going to UNINSTALL this app, because I don't have enough memory in my phone to support the app, which is why I hadn't chosen to download it by choice. I do like Quora, but I do not like ""force"" participation. Makes me feel like the app could be carrying a virus or maybe it's going to collect more data than I want it to, since it's already proven to be deceitful. Probably would have enjoyed the app if you hadn't forced me to install the app.",negative
"This is unarguably the best app for gathering information and sharing your views, knowledge and experience.",positive
Probably the best 'social media' platform around. All about people seeking knowledge and sharing experience.,positive
"It's best app for this generation! But i don't today why it's showing that can't connect to internet i reinstalled it but nothing happened, help me with this",negative
"Love the website. Love the content. Hate to be forced to download something I would've downloaded somewhere in the past 2 years if I wanted to by clicking on the ""Open in app"" tab... If I wanted to.",positive
fills the void devoid of precise knowledge useful in daily life. excellent.....,neutral
The latest update is hindering the scroll and taking up the screen space for reading the content. Not even able to read a full article from the feed.,negative
Best app for curious minds. We have one of the best answering open-minded adults here who can answer any question rationally and thought-provoking. Truly useful app. Would recommend it for everyone.,positive
"Pretty lame questions, feed isn't actually visible. Link feeds are useless and unrelatable. Mostly focused on upvotes rather than quality answers. The people answering the question are stupid and the report center of Quota is useless. Old quora was way better.",negative
Worst app not able to login to this app. Forgot password . Not able to reset password through sent link.,negative
The app sucks. I prefer using the browser. They forced me to install the Quora App while I was reading an answer. I mean at least let me finish reading my answer. I can't even restore from where I stopped reading. The feeds refresh. Worst marketing ever. Such cheap tricks make me want to quit quora all together. I urge the team to fix this.,negative
Takes a lot of time to load text and years to load pictures. Its frustrating.,negative
An amazing app It connects to the social in a very authorized manner I love it. .....üòòüòòü§ì And it gives me various types of knowledge..ü§òüòÅüòÅ,positive
The app doesn't work on my Android phone sometimes. The content doesn't show and the posts are constantly stuck on loading mode. Not sure if it's the app or my phone,negative
"Great platform for people to connect, ask questions and get their answers. Works very well for professionals who want to create a digital space.",positive
"A well polished app with an intuitive interface and impressive algorithms that bring you what you want before you knew you wanted it. Ads that are actually interesting reads. Fascinating, intelligent and very wise users to not only learn from but also interact with. No other app will give you such a deep dive into a subject while maintaining its integrity and objectivity. Easily the best Q&A site and app, hands down.",positive
"This is an excellent way to share life changing information. The questions are relevant, the answers are well thought out, but for old folks, it's unpredictable, and challenging to use",positive
"I don't appreciate the topic navigation feature which is more buggy like an rookie. Fix it, and i can change my rating.",negative
I was forced to download this app if i wanted to read further! This is plain murder of one's choices. I just wanted to read it from the browser but was forced to download it. I vehemently oppose and download it under protest,negative
A very overrated app. It does not show contents which I have selected to read but only shows related topics which I had read earlier. Didn't find it useful at all.,negative
"That is a good app, here you can improve your writing skill and one major thing is that you can know all the experience about all which is shared by other people.Every one can find the solution regarding anything.",positive
"I was forced to install the app. As a result, I blocked quora DNS, I will not use the app or the website anymore. Deleted my account. Forcing users to use the app rather than the web version is not acceptable.",negative
Don't appreciate being forced to download the app just to read the website. It's like yelp -- and this is why I prefer tripadvisor.,negative
"This was an idea I had a long time ago but did not implement in time. A great idea, but only 4 star since the client app still needs a bit polishing.",positive
"The Quora web site relentlessly redirects you to this app. You can use it to write a post, but if you *dare* to go to a browser to check something, your words will be gone when you return. How could a social app be worse than to throw away your typing?",negative
It is the most amazing app for me...and I insist everyone to use it specially who are studying...for the sake of better understanding of some particular topic...,positive
It's a great app and amazing. Whatever you ask you get ur ans but some of them takes time. But great app.,positive
"Luckily I'm not part of the tinfoil hat brigade that freaks out about having to download an app. The questions and answers on the home page could be targeted in more accurate ways. Answered a few questions about wedding bands, and now I keep seeing questions about what rings and other jewelry can be worn with different outfits.",neutral
Worst application when it comes to Loading pictures.?! Really it sucks People who work here are really insane they just keep on deleting your best amswers. Annoying!!!,negative
App is wonderful and I am also a regular user but currently I am not able to see my feed. Can anyone help me out regarding this?? I have re installed it twice,positive
"When i log in with my email id, it says account doesn't exist. When i tried to register, it says email is already registered. Fix it",negative
It has great content covering every possible topic of discussion. There are questions and answers with great content which promotes self learning,positive
"It's a great place for seeking knowledge, yet answers should be supervised and moderated a bit more.",positive
Quiet Biased like other Social apps but a good app to share your perception on innumerable topics and questions.It's Policies irritates us & still Quora is doing nothing for it. My advice for Quora for user experience improvement is to have a inbulit verifier & advicing filters that should check errors according to Quora's policies & then answer should get published which also will help in improving user writing ability and no user will get frustrated using it & stop recommending it to others.,negative
Good app. But as literally everyone has access and right to post; please do not consider things posted as standard one.,neutral
"the mobile website and the app both are not so great, too many bugs. And that sign up dialog with blur on the website is fooling no one. If you have the guts, make search crawlers inaccessible to ur content just like u make it invisible to new users. Also not sure what's the point of email subscription when you are ultimately forcing app downloads.",negative
Very Informative and Addictive..avid readers can enjoy every bit of it. must have app in your list,positive
"It is an informative and interactive app.It deals wirh very interesting topics and debatesbthrough question and answer, which makes the readers knowledgableband keeps them abreast of current situation.",positive
"I have absolutely no idea how you guys get good reviews. You neglect everyone giving you good advice, the app itself is forced upon people and has seemingly no purpose other than to annoy patrons, and trying to use bold or italics is gawd awful. On top of that, you blocked me for retaining my identity!",negative
Nice application. Helps to relax by by reading short and and intersting questions and answers.,positive
"Keeping all the negative reviews aside, this app is a great platform to share knowledge. It's been more than a week or two I started using this app and totally addicted to it no matter if I'm at work or during commute to office. I only wish if the number of characters in a quesg8can be increased by 20-30 more. Cheers!",positive
"Great App. Must ALWAYS open the Answer twice before I can read the full content. Why must I open the application, select ""Read More"" and then, a second screen opens...and again I must, in ALL cases, push on the ""Read more"" then the 2nd screen will open. NEVER can I simply push ""Read more"" and the full story opens up...Rather frustrating!!",negative
I think when we read any topic in this app or site so I think the interface is not attractive I think you should be change to theme and heading ..,negative
"Great for tidbits of knowledge. The latest feeds are a bit too ad filled for my liking, but I guess you can't have everything in life.",positive
"I love quora so much. We first found it i thought it would be like all the other apps i downloaded and would get rid of it after the first day, but i've been using quora for 2 years, 3 phones, and recommend it to everyone.5 starrs 100%.",positive
"This can be a good way to pass the time, give advice or even have a laugh. But the best thing is the new ""partner program"", and I don't know how it'll pan out, but I hope to make a little money from it.",positive
"I haven't been able to open this app since a week. Every time I open it, it just doesn't load and the screen is blank.",negative
"I love asking and answering these questions, but I wish it was easier to find your past posts. Some of the responses I read to a whole range of questions are really insightful.",positive
Really needs bug fix. Can't downland images every time needs to take a screenshot,negative
Quora is forcing us to download the app to read the content by an unclosable popup on the site which is quite functional. Just like FB messenger. I don't understand the need of downloading app if the same things can be accessed via website. Forcing users to download the app gives me an idea of more sinister intentions. #privacy,negative
Such a interesting app! Learned many things directly as well as indirectly through the app! Thanks for such a great platform for sharing knowledge,positive
It is not compatible with Android pie 9.0. Kindly update it for the latest Android version.,negative
"Very good and educative but once a message is read, you can never see it again for the rest of your life, cuz of huge issues with message searching",negative
"Quora as a platform is amazing. However, the app makes my phone to crash and it switches off when I write an answer. This happens a lot of times and almost on a daily basis. But only when I am writing an answer. Kindly fix this issue.",negative
I was forced to download the app why can't I use it simply on the website ..After reading for some time the site redirected me to app ..And a hell lot of bugs .Just hate it.dvlopers please fix the problems,negative
"Quora will lose all of it's credibility because of this annoying bullying app, in my opinion. Why do you need to force me to download this app just in order to read my news feed?? I like reading answers on the browser..but that has been made impossible due to the un-closable popup window appearing on the webpage now, which essentially tells me to either install the app or forget Quora. So then..decision made.",negative
Ads are bothering me. It was excellent before but now it's annoying. The share feature is bombarding my feed with unwanted topics.,negative
"SUGGESTION - please include a dark mode in the app because this is the app which we use to read, we spend lot of time using app . So as to have comfortableness while reading we really need dark mode! And also please give an option to save the photos to our device as its very uneasy to take screenshots . I really hope this feedback catches your eye! Thank you!‚ù§",positive
"Quora is the only place where I prefer the website over the app, that's how slow it is. Had this been anything else, I'd have given up long ago.",negative
I think this is the great platform to learning from experts and share knowledge to who people need to right guidelines and it's very useful and helpful to going to crack your goals thank you very much quora,positive
"Forced to download to read content on the website. As an infrequent user, this is not something that is valuable on my device, but I can't avoid it at all.",negative
In a way was forced to download the app as otherwise cant read much of the content on the quora link.,neutral
"This app is extremely pathetic, one of the worst in playstore, slow, laggy and takes centuries to load any link. It basically overshadows all the good quora has in its content.",negative
"The app finds it very hard to load any content at all. It's very excruciating to watch the app update me about Notifications but then I can access the any content whatsoever. It's always returning the ""404 error"". Please Fix up.",negative
This app is absolutely awesome It helps me figure out various types of problem of different courses,positive
"Adding pop up is one thing but forcing people to download an app is absurd, you guys should work on that after I finish reading what made me visit the website I am deleting the app asap. Don't try to force people to purchase your product very bad for business take note.",negative
"They force you to sign in, they force to install app. No 2nd option, this is not good.",negative
"The inbuilt browser is just as bad as it gets. Fix it or at least, give an option to switch to another browser.",negative
Just came here because of irritating pop up (which destroyed several answers after reading them half) on the browser to download the app.... What if i enjoy quora scrolling trough my browser only.,negative
Great platform to get answers from experience persons on particular field. Very knowledgeable.,positive
"I write a answer after spending lot of hours and after receiving 1.2k quora collapse my answer by giving the stupid reason that I violate the image policy but my answer is only subjected to the answer , it's not a single time quora done it in regular interval , you doesn't even deserve one star.",negative
"Force feeding the app down the reader's throat sucks. Love the answers in the platform though. No i know how important it is, when Wikipedia said they will not display ads",negative
"It's a great app if you have any questions,inquiries or anything like that you will definitely find someone who will provide you with an accurate answer!",positive

The links are really annoying. What happened to old quora. Soon much nonsense stuff.,negative
Ads. Hate them so much. It really takes away from the usefulness of the site,negative
I could find quite a bunch of information on my issues of interest which have enriched my knowledge.,positive
"Please stop the website from advising people to install the app. The mobile webpage is much better designed than the app so just let me use it. Once the notif to install the app comes up, I cannot access the webpage any more",negative
The app is not opening via cellular data. It is only opening via WiFi. Whats the problem?,negative
Simply the worst every time I login either using Gmail or Facebook account it just takes all d information and then never opens....hope they are not selling data,negative
"One of the worst apps on Playstore. First it forces you to use app instead of mobile browser, then it dissapoints you by being unable to load images on posts no matter whether you are on Wifi or 4g. Love Quora, but hate their app",negative
"Is there any way to view awnsers you've upvoted? There was someone who I drew a drawing for, but as soon as I opened the app to add it to the comments of the question, which was open on my quora homepage, it had automatically reloaded it or something, and I couldn't find the question so I couldn't comment with the drawing. I also forgot to follow this question. Help.",neutral
This app is very slow even with 10mbps connection. It fails to load pictures of certain articles.,negative
I am giving it a 1 star because it was highly irritating when the message for app popped up and wouldnt go away no matter what I did. You cant just force someone to download your app.,negative
It's a very nice app to improve your writing skills and English.It can also be a nice hobby to write on this app.This app allows you to share your views about something üëçüëç,positive
This app is a very good platform to share your knowledge and to get knowledge and to learn from experienced persons.,positive

Bugs bugs bugs! Every update brings new bugs. And I keep losing answers I want to read because the app freezes and crashes before I'm done with the answer! Frustrating!!,negative
Photos in answers were not being shown frequently. It looks the App has issues in loading photos.. especially when internet little slow.,negative
It's a nice platform we can get answers to our querries as well as clear doubts of others. It is a place where one can get a question answered to which any clue is not available even on Wikipedia or Google.,positive
"From one of the best platforms for gaining knowledge, to becoming a knock-off of Yahoo Answers, oh how pitiful have you become Quora. I want to read answers, not being bombarded with ads and useless links. Uninstalling, and it will be so until the platform is restored to its former state",negative
"I'm giving one star only because YOU guys forced me to install Quora app. I used to be a regular reader of Quora. Since my android is too slow, i didn't want to install Quora App on my device. I was browsing quora on Chrome today, i was reading an answer and then came this pop-up saying ""install Quora to enjoy full experience"". This is undertandable in promoting their app. But, the worst part is there was no close icon anywhere. I was not able to close that pop-up and i was forced to install this app. This is unacceptable",negative
I am not frequent as writing is concerned but yes I love reading.. And able to explore different mindset of different people around the world..,positive
"No offline support. Even for ""like"" or ""bookmarked"" content. Like when required during flight mode and areas where net access is sporadic.",negative

It's amazing. We could actually have a direct communication through this app to the people around the world. We are able to attain many info with the help of this app!! Thanks to Quora üëç,positive
"When posting a new subject, the size of text aloud is very small. There is no follow-up area with larger text to explain your situation when asking a question. Questions must be very short, not allowing for any detail and what the user is actually trying to attain from an answer.",negative
I used to love Quora a lot. I've begun to hate it now because I can't read a single answer on the browser without signing in. I can't read a answer without having that annoying pop-up that tells me to download the app. I hate having to download an app simply for the sake of reading an answer. I am really disappointed with the team,negative
It is really worth using and it just adds up something everytime uh use it...!!!!I suggest this app to all my frnz and relatives.. M luving it:-*....!!!!,positive

I am rating this 1* exclusively because every single damn page of the website demands you download it with a big non-dismissable pop up.,negative
Attached pictures take enormous amount of time to load up. Answers with pictures thus go unread.,negative
I don't have enough space in my phone so I was accessing Quora through browser but apparently I have to use a app since after a few moments it opens a pop up saying download the 'free' app. If it's free please allow me to use the browser in my phone it hardly makes a difference,negative
"I like QuoraQuora, hav e been using it for years. But why did it force me to install the app and read from the app. The Chrome version is good enough for me to read from. It gives this annoying pop ups, read from the app. Downloading the app because I'm forced to.",negative
A very informative application with a wide variety of questions answered by professionals in respective fields. Also quite entertaining too.,positive
Totally dominated by liberals who don't want free speech and will delete every statement not supporting extreme liberal views. Very biased and sad and disappointing and hence totally useless.,negative
"Can we please get some better texting? Literally the only app on my phone that messes up auto correct, doesn't go to the end of the word when clicked on, and is just really bugging me.",negative
"I enjoy reading different perspectives. I would prefer not to use my name. I realize that every situation is different. But, it's like therapy.",positive
This app is very clean. Would be nice if the ads came in a different color so I can skip reading them.,positive
"That's very cheap of you. You are indirectly forcing all users to download app. Surfing Quora is much better on Web Browsers than on app, we could use dictionary for difficult words, open new links in NEW TABS with ease on Chrome. So don't be another Dumb like Zuckerberg and do FAIR üòâ.",negative
It's it's kind of like having a forum of many different opinions about one thing and that is healthy it is a good source of information just check that it is correct if you use it for anything else,neutral
"They quit allowing me to use the site on my phone and was forced to download the app. I hate being forced to download things when there's no reason I can't just use the site. 1 star until you allow me to delete it and go back to the site without bringing up a pop up in the middle of an article and not allowing me to finish it. Update: after having the app for several months, I absolutely hate it. It is buggy and unless you're on high speed internet (which I'm not most of the time) it will have connection issues constantly. I wish I could go back to using the website on my phone. Please allow me this small thing. This app is driving me mad.",negative
"A dark theme would be incredible for night time reading. Also, a better way to search bookmarked answers would be great.",positive
A good forum for info. However censorship is common if you lean right and conservative on some issues. And it's moderators are rather opaque.,negative
It's really good app for students... We used it for solving our doubts... For inspiration information is written... N many more people's help us ... And we getting more knowledge...,positive
I must admit this application has worst UI...good job now i have to uninstall ...hope everybody is having this issue...dude hire good Android developer.... peace out,negative
Great app. Loved everything. Just one thing: it would be better if you add save button for offline reading.,positive
I like it. It is a very informative and accurate. I can ask questions and get answers back. You get to give facts and opinions.,positive
"Was forced to download app from web site to continue reading. I don't care how good your app is or isn't built, I would rather use the page that pulls up from my emails.",negative
Such a beautiful app for the students around there....almost all the answers of any subject is given there.....you just have to ask...that's all....,positive
I can add languages but how can I save a language as default language? Every time it opens in a language I don't want and every time I must manual change it into english,negative
"Pathetic. I have never used this app, and because of Quora's forceful tactics, I never will. The only reason the mobile website is insufficient is because Quora places an uncloseable advertisement on the website for this stupid app. Well, in my case you'll not get any ad revenue from me, app or otherwise, until I can actually use the damn website.",negative
"Wow! This is an amazing app!!! I've asked and have had answered questions about the US Senate, welding, and properly growing a beard. There is a great variety of topics on here, including history, politics, health issues and personal experiences.",positive
Its a brilliant app. It has answer of all question which bubbles in our mind . Just ask anything and you will get your answer by very professional people having master in that area.,positive
This app provides great user experience but i think night mode should be added to ensure that it is readable during nights...,positive
"Brilliant app, have used every day since installing, just like scrolling through facebool but you learn loads of new things from a different perspective than your life experiences",positive
Good place to share ideas and get clarified for whatever doubts we have . A good idea implemented in a great way letting everyone to write on a topic those who are good at it. Loved to use this app.,positive
An app for intellectuals sharing vast knowledge. Unique and easy to use.,positive
"Love Quora. I enjoy the mature conversations and array of topics. I would like them to add a large array of notification settings so that I dont get notifications when I dont want them, like when I am sleeping.",positive
Quora you are the worst app Quora doesn't let me read from the Google chrome and asks to download the app and when I download the app and go to read that page it shows some error I thought quora would be a good app but it is not. It just waste our internet by asking to download the app and then if we open it just shows us trash. It is a waste of internet and space,negative
"I really like this site but hate that I get emails which redirect me & it's fine but then it wants me to download the app like I'm sorry, it takes too much space on my cell so I stick to offline sites. I shouldn't be forced to use the app if I can already see what I need.",negative
"Quora is a total learning experience for me. Information here are real, from experts and are priceless. I totally love it.",positive
I bookmarked lots of answers on quora. But after new update only bookmarked quistion are displayed bot answeres. New update is useless. Dont download it,negative
Quora is exactly what you would expect from it. My only issue with the app is that I find it hard to find the bookmarks section.,negative
"Instead of my bookmarked answers, in the bookmarks section there are only the questions of my bookmarked answers. Developers thinking that they can delete any functionality at any time is the most absurd thing ! Now, I am supposed to search the answers that I liked in the pool of 2000-5000 answers! The worst update ever, it is. I don't recommend downloading this app.",negative
"Previously quora has minimalistic design. Now bottom navigation bar along with tab bar containing images occupying more bottom space, which made me feel bad about the app. I think developer may add an option to keep and remove this tab bar.",negative
It's a very good app. It increases communication skills and knowledge about world and to contact or know different thinking of men or how do men can think differently at one topic...,positive
"such an amazing app. to know the facts and figure, but one things bugs me up, in my home page I got que. and related to bad qualities of India only, most of them in negative sense. for smthng gud I hv to search alit",negative
"Quora, inc is a great app, not only for scientists and physicists but also great for students. I recommend it for every teacher.",positive
The number of ads and other cluttered items are making it worse day by day. The quality of answers has gone down by a significant margin. Please go back to the original interface.,negative
I am enjoying using this app a lot.. it give all the possible data or me to check my stats but i cannot see the feedback comment box likes and dislikes... overall made life easy.. i am enjoying Thank a lot for the app i am loving the user experience must try..,positive
I find most of the questions and their answers to be very interesting and thought provoking. It gives you a different view point on life's challenges and situations.,positive
"I like it, the only little problem thay I can see is that you can not add numbers to your username, which kinda sucks... Other that that, I enjoy the app...",positive
This is sucking battery of my new mobile like anything. I am sure something is really wrong and developer has to fix this.,negative
"I like it, but the way you push user from browser to download without close button is not forgivable",neutral
Thank you quora. YOU did a great job.. Its very useful for me... You are blessed with Great talent... All the people in the world are giving their own answers. Opinions. Suggestions good..,positive
The UI is a bit clumsy. It often doubles back on itself during a swipe over. Notifications don't clear on the answer tab. Colors are bland- throw a medium blue in the app. Overall it's fairly smooth and navigable. Comparable to the larger sites with more content and traffic.,negative
Very nice app.. Although doubt the authenticity of answers at times.. but good platform to share views and ideas,positive
Yes you can get some relevent stuff.. .. &some irrelevant also ......but it is awsome anyway. New version has bugs & keeps hanging ; please fix it :team quora,negative
Pathetic app : I don't know why you are forcing us to download the app that sucks at loading pictures and other stuff While I can see that without any problem in chrome and I need to save the answer in the app just to look the pics again,negative
Making your web version completely unusable with an un-closeable pop up forcing us to use the app is plain scummy. I've lost a lot of respect for Quora as a company.,negative
I enjoy using the app. Very impressed by the information you can actually find... I only have one issue and thats with layout format as it can be difficult to identify ads.. maybe add different colours and contrasts ...,positive
The app is really great but really takes forever to load an image. This isn't acceptable in an era where the technology is advancing every day. Hope the team takes a note of it.,negative
"It's an amazing app, I like it because it provides reliable answers to complex questions from people who have experience in that particular aspect!",positive
"I love this app. I might not be right on some advice I give. But, I do say, In my opinion this is what I think unless I know for sure. You have everything on here all in 1 place. Great app! Glad I found it!",positive
"Quora is one of the best place where you can go through different topics or answer your experiences,it helps people to explore and gain knowledge on technologies. One of the site to kill free time in office or when travelling or when alone.",positive
IRRITATING The only reason I installed this app was because the website kept popping messages to ask me to download this app . Moreover the message was not quitable so I had to reopen the page everytime. I am really disappointed ...,negative
The app is interesting. It connects me to the world. It's a place I can share or ask anything and get feedback from the community.,positive
"Need a history button, for previous questions read. Since I lose a lot of reading midway when I minimise the app",neutral
I like it alot.. want to say love. Want to give it 5 stars.. but is a bit buggy.. amazing insightful awakening opposite of brain numbing facebook,positive
"Installed so I could give this 1 star review, will now uninstall. Would've been happy reading forever on the internet, but no, you had to popup a forced download box with no option to ignore it. Was just starting to enjoy the answers, now I'll never be a user. WTG, developers.",negative
"I can't access the app!!! There is a bug in the app that keeps telling me ""connection timed out"".. even though I am connected to the internet",negative
This app is really good but it would become more popular and very effective if you add languages credentials to Urdu and Arabic to reach the viewers...,positive
"What an amazing app ! Its actually like a family here.so many things to learn from different people ,make friends ,learning etc",positive
"I didn't register for Quora app or even subscribed .I gave it one star cos couldn't leave a 0 .I had to install this app now as to undo Quora from my private email box because. I noticed unsubscribe at the bottom of Quora contents in my mail box Unsubscribe twice I click again today , plus emailing didn't stop Quora resending its stuff didn't stop Quora sending daily lots of its contents .

"Good - often fascinating stories. Some dross, but well worth reading. Unfortunately, the text, from enail alerts, does not load in Android 7 (it does on my old tablet, Andtoid 4).",positive
Quora is just amazing platform for knowledge and i love this just..everything is fine its just hang sometimes and show some error popup that's all .thank you:),positive
"Why do you want to force users into downloading the app for mobile?? The moment we start reading something, the pop up for downloading the app comes up and the best part is there is no close button. Sir we know that you have an App, but guys like me are perfectly happy with a browser experience on mobile. You spread the news that you have an App and promote it day in and day out. No issues. Atleast provide the option to close the popup.",negative
"This app is pretty damn good and does almost everything I want it to. The only issue I have with it is that if you switch between apps whilst writing an answer, then the page will time out when you come back. Fix that issue and my review will be 5 stars.",positive
A very helpful app. One of my favorite app is quora . One should must have it to get knowledge and information regarding studies and other things.,positive
Quora is best app to get knowledge and have some fun also. But now a days I have seen a bug which disabled the feed and show profile page instead. Hope Quora resolves the bug,negative

Very good app which helps to use the mobile productively. Keep improving the service. üëçüèΩ,positive
"From 26MB down to 2.9MB; now, that's what I call magic! Really good job, thanks. I am really missing proper app release changelogs.",positive
"Fabulous way to interact with people online. Unique, easy to use forum for discussions. Love it!",positive
Literally only downloaded it to unsubscribe from their emails. Which they dont let you do from browser,neutral
Forcing people to download the app instead of just allowing them to use the website. Pretty crappy tactic from what I thought was a good website. Shame on you.,negative
Unable to upvote after the last update and it is not worth the tagline and is rather full of advertisement.,negative
Good source for information. Experts views on subject give nice insight. But the navigation and browsering is little slow but manageable.,positive
It's the most useful app if you want learn something new everyday. You will become addictive of this.,positive
After update it is terrible. When we press the back button it totally closes the app..if it is like this I'm gonna Uninstall this.,negative
It's a app where you can find answers (which r answered by random people) to questions (which r asked by people). It's basically a knowledge learning app if you seem good .,positive
"I am a really big fan of this app. The ability to not just ask any question and receive an answer, but it's super easy to to find a world of interesting questions to answer, or to respond to people that have responded to questions. I was originally worried that I would be bombarded by hatespeech and conspiracy theories but have so far I have not run into any of such problems.",positive
They ask you loads of time to install the app and then it doesn't even have a night mode. Use cookies or whatever to remember the decision not to download the app. Reading in a browser I'm night mode is much better...,negative
"It's an OK app. Not better than just using it through browser though. Giving it a dislike for forcing me to download the app (unclosable popup), even though the browser version worked just fine.",neutral
"Promoted contents, ads and ""you may like"" contents take 90% of space and hardly any topic of your selection is shown. It is also very difficult to get rid of topics you selected while setting up. Disappointed!",negative
"I like the app, usually get emails with relevant topics, but that doesn't seem to be the case when using it just natively without email. Still a good app though.",positive
The new version is simply terrible. Answers expand in the same window. Major annoyance.,negative
It's now giving me 404 error when I'm on mobile data. Arggghhh!! You guys are frustrating me with these useless updates you put that only makd things worse. Now I can't even see what's on Quora anymore,negative
"This is the big plat form for saying our own idea, shearing feelings & opinions with local as well as ginious person who available on quora. There are lots of amazing people available at this place so thanks for this amazing apps this is also the best opportunity for improvise our English by reading the different thoughts and ideas & by shearing our opinion by writing.",positive
"Quora is alright at best because the answers are typically qualified. However this can cause issues with who gets allowed to provide a good answer and its fairly easy to promote your product instead of supply an unbiased result. The app itself has a terrible UI and is in no way intuitive. Overall, there are much better sources for most information in a more free exchange of ideas and better interface than what Quora provides.",negative
"I don't have a problem with the app per se, I have a problem with the ridiculous hardball tactics that have brought me to this page. In fact, I already have the app installed, however, occasionally I prefer to use the browser based version, which recently forces you to this page due to a pop up (that apparently can't be dismissed) prompting you to download the app. Unfortunately, I cope with this by leaving bad reviews on any page or product that I am forced to visit or install. It's 2018. We all know you want people to download the app. But seriously, stop being annoying about it. FOAD.",negative
"It's very useful to know about different ideas, way of life, culture, politics and education. I get so many messages which unavailable in my living place, I don't have people of this kind very near to me.so l like this very much.",positive

"Please, highlight the ads atleast so you know where the answer stops and the ad begins.",neutral
I am eagerly read various topics and enjoy all the moments with quora. Lot of things I came to know with the help of quora. I am really proud of quora. I have changed my Google account long back and since that day I could not upvote. Kindly solve the problem. Thanks,positive
"Quora is a really good platform for you to broaden your knowledge. But it has something to be fixed. Technical things. I can't upvote answers anymore. I have reload it, close the app and re-open it, and it still doesn't work. Would you do something about that? Thank you!",negative
Feed shows same things again and again that really sucks. I've subscribed many topics but feed shows only few topics repeatedly again and again.,negative
"It was doing pretty good overall but after using it for a week, it shows err. Too many redirects and doesn't open any more. I tried using different browsed to open quora and also downloaded this app but it still doesn't work. Please fix it and then I'll give 5 stars",negative
"#Help_plz I have been using quora since many days ago, recently the app shows, it cant connect to internet whereas my other apss are running well with internet. Internet setting is okey. What can I do now...",negative
An amazing platform for writers as well as readers. It is a hub of knowledge.,positive
Even after updating it says server error. It doesn't load. I prefer using the web version.,negative
It's a nice platform for sharing information. It's good for students who seek real-life advises. One keeping himself away from love & relationship related topics can make the best use of this platform!,positive
It makes compulsory update and download. and when it is to be downloaded it doesn't happen so. One more thing mostly vulgar questions are answered and liked the answer of.,negative
An app which help us to know the opinion of experts in different field easily.,positive
I get to learn a lot from this app... I get to interact with great individuals who share life experiences and knowledge rather than just fake selfies....,positive

"Ever since I downloaded the last update, my quora has gone haywire. In my read section, it is showing the about You part. I'm unable to read any questions. Kindly help.",negative
Most topics are interestingly written in knowledge and wisdom but l have struck a few that have been empty accept for the writing of a braggard of sorts and l was not interested at all.,negative
"The platform needs significant improvement, mostly converting word math editor file to quora format. The page layout needs colors and versatility to compete against other platformsl",neutral
"Needs much more modifications like profile settings, linking other questions, sharing shared topics over other communication platforms and bookmark shared topics too. It should keep the upvoted topics for future reference too.! Should have a history option for future reference.",neutral
"Beautiful app , only grouping need to improve also struggling to find anynomas options of writing",positive
"Great platform for sharing information, needs more advertising and Im sure everyone needs to be part of this learning community.",positive

One of My favourite app turned into a piece of Junk. Connectivity issue is still present after frequent updates.Now the only way to get rid of it is to use web version. Plz Add save page feature for offline Reading after fixing above mentioned issue.,negative
I just wanted to read some q and a's on the web but a pop-up informing me if I would like to download the app continuously blocked my viewing. There was no fricking close button so I just resorted to downloading it. No issue with the app per se but the continuous pop-up up freaking irritated me.,negative

"Ok, with the latest update - The uniform scrolling is good to be used but how to collapse back the answers after I've read them browsing through the app... it confuses and not looks good while scrolling.",negative
Just an excuse to send people garbage in their email. I had to reinstall the app to turn off the notifications. I'm pretty sure there's a legal requirement to be able to unsubscribe from the trash they send. Update: still getting the emails. Please take me off your list.,negative
There is no doubt about Quora... But in my android phone this app takes a time to load images even having a speed of 3 Mbps fix this issue please,negative
Why you are forcing us to download your app...even though your web version is great...i hate your app and search engine of app...because in website we have lot of flexibility also i can directly search on google anything by puting tag quora so i can get more specific lino because you need to accet that your app search engine is not good...,negative

"What irritates me the most is, if the answer contains pictures and you mistakenly click on them and you don't have pretty fast internet connection the app will not let you scroll and images doesn't open up fast the only option is to close the app and you lose the answer and it refreshes the feed again.",negative

"Why the hell should I download this app just to open Quora? I want to be able to open Quora in my phone browser. The app tends to bug me with constant notifications, which then leads to binge reading and writing, something I don't want to happen as it triggers unhealthy habit for me. I'm uninstalling. I would only open Quora from my PC. It is healthier for me. Oh, and yes. You just lose a fan. I frequent Quora less and less because of your elitism of not letting Quorans visit Quora from their phone browsers.",negative
Make easy access of particular bookmarked answer..... Or provide some shorting method in bookmark section that would really really needed and helpfully also......,neutral

And now we have to deal with the annoying pop-up prompting you to download the app even if u don't want to, and it doesn't go away unless u hit the ""back"" button and start over again to get to what you were reading , and it keeps coming back! NIW I HATE QUORA!!!!",negative

Voicing out thoughts or opinion over people's questions. And voting, sharing, commenting. I love it.",positive

It is really good but it often hang so much and don't connect properly. While typing something it suddenly closes. Please sort out this issue,negative
Lost another reader because you started forcing a popup to install the app. You did this a few months ago. This time I've unsubscribed from your digest.,negative
"I really love this app. It's a great place to consume knowledge and perspectives on some serious and not so serious topics. Things I've always wanted the answer to and things I didn't even know I wanted the answer to. And I feel smart when people ask me for my opinion. And sometimes I feel like a dumb ass for not knowing. Once you start reading responses you realize this social media site is like nerd, dork and brown noser central. Not that there's anything wrong with that ;) I would give this app 5 stars but what truly gets on my nerves is the incessant advertising, that disguise themselves as quora questions. Not cool.",positive
"After the 1/2018 update, the feed is a mess, cluttered with random article links, ads, and unfollowed questions/answers. Became unreadable.",negative
"A damn disgrace that any company puts content on the net for public viewing only to then put a non-closable pop up blocking content and demanding you download their app, failure to download said app means you cannot read content. As I say disgraceful behaviour, make it clear from the start that the app is needed to read any content, that way people have informed choices the second they read any content.",negative
Only downloading the app since the website literally will not let me read for more than 15 seconds before giving me an unclosable ad for the app.,negative
"Just allow us to use Quora on Mobile browsers, I can't scroll through the feed on Chrome browser unless I download the app. Disgusting!",negative
Worst app.....site is good but this app is so irritating. . i can't sign in or log in....stupid varification system :-(,negative
"The app has always been slow and buggy. It's surprising how much time it is taking them to fix this given the app has so little to do. But now it's reached heights. It simply refuses to work on my new Nokia 6.1 plus. It keeps loading for 2-3 minutes and finally says can't connect to network. No other app is having any problem. The site works fine on Chrome. But the app just won't load. Reset permissions, reinstalled, nothing works. Edit: and now they're forcing me to use the app. Can't use the website through chrome either. Bye bye Quora",negative
Good content but the user experience is rather clunky. Not really smooth.,negative
"Terrible layout and implementation. The idea of Quora is excellent, but the logic and layout of the app is utter madness.",negative
There are some good articles helping me to be more mature and giving me skills to deal with this complicated world. Telling the truth and be objective is the reason that I like quora.,positive
It will anyway collapse your answer if it correct or not. All your time and energy will be lost for no reason.,negative
Very informative. Productive way to pass time. I like that there are topics for everything.,positive
"After I installed this app and opened it, it keeps loading but nothing really gets loaded. Really disappointed with how the problem has existed for months. I highly hope that Quora will fix this.",negative
"The app gives you lot to read, lot to write lot to grasp and lot to imagine. If U feel like using this app, without a thought go for it.",positive
It is fun to share experiences for ideas on how to be human for others less capable of searching the web.,positive
"Very sketchy performance. Doesn't load pages on phone internet, idk why. Only usable with an wifi connection",negative
Full of helpful contributors around the world that share their insights on every aspect. I keep getting inspired by this app.,positive
The only thing I hate about this is that when I'm trying to do stuff on my web browser this thing pops up after like 30 seconds and practically forces me to download the app so I can finish what I'm doing so yeah I hate everything about your stupid website and app :),negative
Selecting topics was not user friendly. There is no real rapport.,negative
"Disappointing. - forces you to download the app to continue reading articles, lest you scroll halfway down and be gatekept from reading the rest.",negative
Great think tanks and amateurs gather on the website to discourse and learn ideas and knowledge of all kinds of subjects and areas from academics to small trivial life stuff you want to know and share. You are awesome.,positive
I don't like the way you force everyone to install the app. There is no way to use mobile web. After sometime a huge popup will come which cannot be removed.,negative
"Pathetic app. Very slow, too many errors and bugs.",negative
Facing problem in quora app from last one month. Its getting too laggy and shows error while opening often. You guys need to work it out to resolve this.,negative
This app is an awesome place to learn something and share your thoughts and ideas. One of my favorite sites!,positive
Please make lite version if possible. App is very slow. Please fix this if possible. Till then I unistalled it. Sorry,negative
Interface can be improved. Rest everything is perfect! Great app!,positive
App is fast but the message part is bad. You can't reply To 2 messages at same time we have to close the app and then open the app to reply to next message,negative
"If you can add activity log in this app, then it would be great help. I really need the option of activity log like Facebook.",positive
quora is educative but a great distraction not letting read answers from browser and popping up notifications to download app is turn off who wants to read just casually not spend hours on it which is the purpose of it people writing fake stories fake answers just for their personal satisfaction I am saying this i have thought about it too know people who do it the soul purpose of quora is now defeated,negative
I think quora is an intelligent app in the sense that I get a lot of authentic information in a very interesting way--most of the members are well informed and quite logical in their responses--i have also improved my writing prowess,positive
"Its a nice and meaningful app. But they can do it better in terms of management, the server gets down quite of few times but still the objective of the app snatches star out of you. Its worth of ypur time.",positive
"For the last few weeks the app will only load a few answers (in any category, from my digest, from a search, whatever) but the little 'loading dots' at the bottom never get replaced. Please fix it. Separately, please can we have an offline mode? Quora could be great for the subway/flights.",negative
I love this app when i want to know unbiased and genuine answer but it is too internet intensive for poor network area. I cannot read a single full answer these days. I think Quora Team need to learn from google products e.g Youtube. I can stream Youtube Video almost everywhere.,negative
"This app is great overall but lags off a bit while loading pages The site version loads pages much faster than the app version, just need a boost to the speed",positive
Quora is such a unique app!! You will find an answer to almost every single question you might have. The app is also very fun and easy to navigate!,positive
"Quora your app is broken!! It seems that you force us to download the app. While browsing Quora on Chrome I got a pop-up which suggested me to download the Quora app, and it refused to go away no matter what I did. Now, it's worth mentioning that I already have the Quora app, but prefer using it in chrome. Because it takes a lot longer to load pages in app, the keyboard doesn't show up while replying for msg, and every time I click to read an answer it has to reload to go back to the previous page. So please fix your app, and stop forcing people to download your app. Else you are going to lose readership.",negative
So you have to compulsorily download the app to read any content that exceeds 100 words! WOW!,neutral
Love this app. But please don't imitate feeds from other social media website. Please keep you Q&A UI. This Oct update is really not helping,negative
Forcing us to download the app instead of letting us access all pages on web browser is exactly what a dictator would do!!,negative
I am able to get detailed answers for a number of doubts in a variety of subjects by people who have knowledge of the subject as well as experience.,neutral
Great app for getting answers and insight for just about everything. It could be helpful tool for business or personal inquiries.,positive
See I love using Quora but now a days it has became very slow and buggy. Please fix it soon I am not willing to give 1 star but this is only the way to bring it to your notice. Respected developers please fix this issue. Hope Quora will be back again like it was earlier. üëç,negative
What I like abt the apps is you can specifically pick and search topic of what you would like to see in your news feed.,positive
I really happy to use this app...it's very helpful for student .it provides a knowledge about respective field which you want to know.,positive
"The app is very interesting as it contains a lot of information which can make the students life bright.The nice thing is that we can question to anyone using this application it involves perfect knowledged person,I love this app Thanks to quora",positive
"Why have a mobile website if you're always going to stop me halfway through reading an answer with a persistent popup that can't be closed telling me to get this application. Well I finally did it! Enjoy the one star, I know it's not anything in the grand scheme of things but whatever!!",negative
"Quora website forced me to download this web based app. I received my Quora mailed which I signed up for but when I clicked to open Quora site, a pop up appeared and was impossible to close it directing to this app which looks exactly like the website. Now I love reading answers on Quora but please don't shove the app on people's face. Not everyone has space on their phone and some people prefer website to save space.",negative
"Too many know it alls and inconsistent moderation policies. A person can be on your case and the mods never know. Some stories get so lewd, it is irrelevant, just showing off. It is a waste of my time and I have had stories on here with thousands of views.",negative
If a dark mode or dark theme could be added then it would become more comfortable to be used in night or low light conditions.,neutral
"I think this app is literally awesome! Just about any question you can think of is answered by many different people from all walks of life so you can get all sorts of differing opinions. You can ask your own questions or answer questions from other people, it's a great app for getting advice or information and it's also great for just entertaining yourself when you're bored. I would definitely recommend this app to friends and family.",positive
It is a nice app which worked as a fire brigade for me. Thanks a lot for developing such a nice platform.,positive
"What the hell is the matter with this app. Always it shows an error when opened, saying bad gateway. Then why do you even create this application. There is no recent search history. Why should I always type. This is all Heck.",negative
"Have only had the availability of the app for s short time, I find the subjects covered staggering from so many people. I will definitely hope to use the app more in the future. Thanks and regards, John Hayes.",positive
When you get struck at something in life it is a great source of information and therefore great to fall back upon.,positive
Great platform to share and gain knowledge and at the same time it give access to learn new things and to connect with some interesting people.,positive
"This is really an useful app. But its current update is so bogus, that many times it fails to open pages where the internet connectivity is perfectly fine. Please update if you want to see more viewer in near future. Thanks.",negative
Very good app to get answers to ur questions. And also to give answer to someone's questions.,positive
One of the best social network I use which is very knowledgeable supportive and helping psychologically me and through out the world I love it..,positive
"It's social media, but not an usually one, it might brainwash you, if you are like that....but I would advice everyone this social Media, as it can teach you a lot of things and ..........",neutral
Awesome app.you can increase your knowledge.you can ask anything you want.you can get more experience guys advice each and every topics.i love this app.,positive
"Very informal factual and a really interesting read, Prefer this to all the rubbish you find yourself lost in on the internet nowadays. Also not bombarded with crappy ads taking over the screen all the time! very impressed!",positive
"The app does nothing that their mobile website didn't do, and does a few things worse. I say ""didn't"" instead of ""doesn't"" because it is no longer possible to use their mobile website; while it's still there, if you open it, a pop-up appears immediately to tell you that you can't view Quora on mobile without downloading the app. I'm not going to keep bloatware on my phone if the only thing it's done is inconvenience me, and since there are no features on the Quora app that weren't satisfactory on the website, the only reason the app is now mandatory is that Quora doesn't mind losing some percentage of users in its attempt to force all of its mobile users to give them app-level access to their phones. I'm fine with the ads that Quora's mobile website showed. I'd put up with more of them than that. What I'm not fine with is this level of callous disregard for Quora's users, the naked admission that our phones are the product that they've built their mobile division to harvest, so that they can sell it to their actual customers in the marketing industry. Because what else does making the app mandatory gain them? A simple reminder would serve any other purpose; for it to lock you out of the website entirely without the app is to outright say that driving some people off their service entirely isn't a problem if it coerces some other people into downloading the app when they would have preferred not to. I've got better things to do with my time than continue supporting anyone who pulls a stunt like this. Goodbye, Quora.",negative
I'm not so thrilled with what just happened. I was editing a previous answer on quora when it suddenly closed all my open Android tasks.,negative
"Been a knowledge jar for me. Well designed. Ads dont seem like one, without interuppting the user. Thank you.",positive
It is great medium to gain and spread knowledge around the world. Simply say Awesome !!!,positive
Great platform for knowledge....but nowadays it's becoming sort of sex story app which is not appreciable...so i request my fellow quorans to let quora be a knowledge platform only. Else A great App,neutral
It is very helpful and motivation and also different point of view which help us ..,positive
"5 stars are for the contents on Quora. This app, however, is not that great. Out of the plethora of problems, one is that if while reading some answer, we minimise the app for a while and go back to it, the app restarts itself and the old content is gone forever. For a person like me, it is a big turn-off. Will hope that it gets better someday. Content wise this app is amazing, but, I am not a big fan of its moderation team though!",negative
My girlfriend introduced me to and I find it to be very interesting and in some cases validating! It's always nice to conversate with like minded individuals!,positive
I always enjoy reading story's information and advice on Quora sadly not able to read all but I do read a lot of stuff.,positive
"After my new update to marshmallow on moto x play, it stops responding and even when it runs it lags, please fix this because apparently I cannot live without quora",negative
Its a great app. But these days I find it gets stuck in between and I have to turn it off and start again which really irritates sometimes. Overall it's a great app for knowledge sharing.,negative
"Enjoyable! Goes into subjects that are not necessarily the standards, always interesting and informative",positive
"This is by far the most informative, interesting and truthful site on so many topics! I read Quora every night, sometimes 3 hours or more! I love love love this forum!",positive
Unwanted App that you forced me to use. Apps shouldn't be mandatory. Customers are still customers and have the right to choose not to use or accept your contemptuos techniques.,negative
Nice app for writers or who like to write or read.. Only one problem.. This app lags too much while writing a long answer.. It abruptly stops working some times. Otherwise every thing is good.,positive
Simple....Helpful.....It is really Best to search on quora than searching a specific info on Google....It gets here very easily in words of experienced person,positive
"Very useful app to read and know about a wide range of interesting subjects and things. Help us to get enlightened about the things happening around us. Be it daily life,human behaviour, politics, finance,etc.,etc.,you can have the details.",positive
Too many stupid questions. Should be a filter for decent questions and ones that people can figure out by reading and practical skills.,negative
"It works very well, and it looks good. Streamlines version of the site, as any great app should be!",positive
I think this is the best platform to share our views and knowledge anlong with it we are also able to surf and stay updated.,positive
Most of the images fail to load. Better to access through web browser than the app.,negative
"Great for spending your time learning about other people's experiences in life and interacting with an international community. The app does feel a bit clunky though, but perhaps that's just me.",positive
"A very good App, I like it much. It can be better if the answers to a question may be sorted in a choronological order.",positive
I love this app because there is a lot of information on a wide variety of topics. Never will run out of things to learn with this app.,positive
"It's really interesting, it forces you to reflect on your own life and you can see where you have evolved and maybe where you have some work to do too.",positive
"If there should be 10 star rating,I wold give the maximum!A fine app. !Very useful,Increases your knoweledges in every field of life.",positive
"An amazing app that it's worth more than 5 stars. You can inquire, answer and find answers about anything you may think of.",positive
Positive for opinion pieces. Have not clocked a great deal of snark. People seem to genuinely want common sense answers to questions.,positive
"five star for the older version, since i updated it , its a worst nightmar. app talking time like hell to open up. too much laggy. fix it or remove it from play store.",negative
Is a nice app to see views of people on different issues. Good knowledge sharing app and website. You can choose different subjects that you want to scrutinize.,positive
"Quora is the best platform for gathering and sharing information and knowledge. It is a great app for reading, writing and assimilating knowledge.",positive
"Cannot manage between multiple questions, its much better to just use it on a browser.",negative
A perfect website to get all answer nd a gud interface... Plzz provide an option to save or bookmark our favorite answers,positive
"It is one of the best apps available in the playstore. It is giving lot of information about academics, society etc . Your linguistic skills will also improve through this app .",positive
For those who have not experienced this app I sincerely recommend you to install it. In this you will find and solve all your problems. You won't regret it. Best app ever. Thxx.,positive
"The option of post question anonymously doesn't work. When i type a question post it by clicking the option post anonymously, the screen blanks away and goes to my phone home screen.",negative
I just downloaded this app when opened it says 404 not found I'm experiencing the same error on crome as well please let me know what is causing this error btw I'm browsing from Nigeria.,negative
"The app doesn't refresh on its own very frequently. For an example, lets say when the upvote history in laptop shows 100. But mobile app would show 80. That means, It doesn't sync withe the original Quora database frequently. You need to restart the app to see the latest update on a thread. Please work on this sync issue. Otherwise it's awesome.üëçüëçüëç",negative
"The app is very helpful and knowledgeable. I think it is better to scroll down this app rather than scrolling down facebook app. Lots of information can e learned. However, I did not like the app interface.The interface could be more better. I hope developers will look into the matter.",positive
"Simple and easier to navigate than the site. I've ran into a couple of bugs, but other than that it is very responsive and gets the job done.",positive
It's good platform to ask any question about in need. I prefer it just for only reading purpose only.,positive
Too many misleading & spamming ads have been introduced which also serves to minimize the viewing area,negative
"One star for FORCING me to download the app in order to view the page I was on, click anywhere on screen away from pop up, nothing, back out and it kicks you off the page you were on. Boo!",negative
I am really naive in the cyber world. I enjoy this app though. Very informative and it's an honor to voice my opinion when questioned,positive
Best app till mow . It has helped me a lot . But sometimes it requires to edit my question due to errors but there is no error in question. But apart from this problem i am just addicted to this app and never gonna uninstall it . Loved it soo much,positive
This is an amazing app for all people.. either student or teacherfor everyone and very helpful app..,positive
You can use the website on a PC all you want but you have get blocked from using the website too much in your phone as and s pop up to install the app appears with no way to bypass it.,negative
it needs some improvements in Newsfeed and search engine.Make it more relevent. And the main thing is it was wonderful media at beginning but after some days it becomes so boring with its newsfeed,negative
"Great app with a great community. However, I really wished they didn't take away the ""details"" feature. It was super helpful as your question will almost always get marked as ""needs refining"" if the question is too specific. Now with that gone, questions can be slightly confusing as you can't properly explain your question.",positive
"I'm not even sure if I like the app or not. All I know is it wouldn't let me finish reading the answer I was looking at without downloading the app. It gave me a pop up which blocked the screen, and which I couldn't get rid of, so I downloaded it, but gave it one star because it forced me to.",negative
"All I want to do is read through my feed and answer questions on the SITE. I don't have enough space on my phone as is and I sure as h*ll don't need quora forcing me to download their ridiculous app. Why can't I read even half of an answer without your (unclosable, I might add) ""download our app!"" pop up blocking my ability to read and scroll? This is pathetic.",negative
It's ridiculous that you put up an overlay that I can't close on your perfectly functional website to force me to use this mobile app instead. And while I'm in the middle of reading a post no less. I refuse to install this.,negative
It is forcing me to use the app and not allowing me to see in browser. When I use the app the answers don't load properly. I am sick and tired of it.,negative
"Why do you intentionally forces users to download app when accessing it through web browser? Everytime your ""Download free ad"" pops up, and there is no way after it to use quora except going back to previous page. Bad business tactic though.",negative
"I am more comfortable in reading stuff on my browser, eliminating the need of an extra space consuming app.. YOU CANNOT FORCE PEOPLE TO DOWLOAD YOUR STUPID APP... Stop your cheap trick now or you will lose ur reputation..",negative
The best app in my smartphone and I will suggest this app for every teen-agers who are just wasting there precious time somewhere else‚úç,positive
Why would I use the app when external sites consistently don't work. Blocking my browser viewing experience while insisting i download the app is a new low for quora,negative
"Great app, interesting questions. There is a TON of information, much of it nothing short of intriguing.",positive
I was forced to download this app. Your annoying pop-up couldn't be closed. This is bad. Nobody should be forced to download anything.,negative
Very informative and really let's you connect with the world. Great insights.,positive
I can't even read comment in browser since I have this app. Its just blocks the entire content on browse and forces to install the app. This is just bullying you into installing the app. Pathetic !!!!!,negative
The app is very buggy and not user friendly. It needs a lot of work on its presentation and how the app functions with different people. 3/5 is just for the content. The app is not at all user friendly.,negative
Do NOT force anyone to download an app to read something. Your freaking download the app thing takes over the webpage and makes it impossible to view the page. I don't want to be forced to take up memory on my phone when your webpage worked just fine two minutes ago. Seriously considering deleting my whole account.,negative
Awesome app for getting a quick start in your field of interest. Kind of a discussion forum where people share their opinion and experiences which if carefully utilized are of great help!!,positive
Awesome. Met lots of interesting people and I am able to express myself through writing very well.,positive
Nice app allows you to know and comment on all the things that are of your interest and is also a great time killer....üòâüòâ,positive
One of the favorite apps ever.It has stuff which people actually want... Best place to spend the time. Thanks so much for such a good platform.,positive
why cant i use your site instead.. you cant force us to download the app always. one may not have space or whatever. Its our choice to download app or continue using the site. one star because of that.,negative
Good app that keeps us up to date with current trends in technology and some things that we are curious to know.,positive
"The app was fine with me. But now every time I open it, it shows ""can't connect to the internet"" despite there is no problem with my internet. Please fix this.Thanks in advance.",negative
Its good.. Keeps me busy especially when sometimes um not feeling good.. It keeps me busy and updated about my favourite reading stuff.üòÑ,positive
Quora is just the best. What an absolutely elegant and smart platform for equally elegant and smart people.,positive
"I adore the forum, the content and especially the intelligent writers. I like the way it finds questions for you in your areas of expertise. I wish the format were more intuitive.",positive
"Okay, it has vast amount of knowlege. But when i browse through various intersting question, I had to read it and go back again to read answers to another question....... So there should be an option to 'open in new window'. However the quora website serves well on this purpose, but the app needs an upgrade for that.",neutral
"Hate when apps stop working until you update them, and they don't even tell you why are you updating it, what new have you added.",negative
Was a big fan of Quora. Still is. Then why 1 star? Because you forced me to install the app. You didn't let me read what I was trying to read on your webpage. It's the user's choice whether to use the app or the website. Some people might not have enough storage space in their phone. And thts the reason why they don't install the app. Well this move from your side affected the user experience badly.,negative
Excellent I love this app you get quick answers to your question and its also user friendly.,positive
"Forcing someone to download the app just to finish reading the article is F***ED UP!!! Now that I've posted this comment, I'm going to remove the app. Really spoilt the article I was enjoying. Pathetic",negative
"I reduced a star. I will give 5 stars once the night reading mode available. Good going guys, congratulations.",positive
"Interesting to hear ""grass roots"" issues written and answered by both those with a diagnosis and health professionals. A fairly unique forum.",positive
Extremely satisfied and happy with the app. The introduction of spaces has made it even better now. Kudos to Adam D Angelo and the entire Quota team for doing such a great job. Keep it up.,positive
Great app to make you read on many questions answered. Too many people ask many question and get many answered in return. Good for knowledge and gain your answers.,positive
This is a versatile platform where you have exhaustive and different perspective on variety of subjects. Information provided and discussed on any subject is attached with proper links of the source .,positive
"It's one of the best social and intellectual apps can't do without. You can be behind, on latest research and trending topics... Good work. Recommended for those who want to stay smart.",positive
"Its an unlimited source or knowledge, by reading ,learning,asking one can attain much more. It helped me so much. I loved it",positive
Quora can be described as an intelligent version of Reddit. Or a more interactive version of Wikipedia. It's great !,positive
"I am just now trying the app so when I've finished getting my feet wet, I'll be better able to comment...(but if it's as good as it's sounds...and delivers... I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT!)",positive
A great app but does crash sometimes due to heavy use. There are plenty of time wasters and trolls but Quora is doing great to tackle the problem.,negative
"Good platform to share information, views and also helps to keep one updated.",positive
That link for you in between is so much irritating!! Plz make option to disable them! Edit - they decreased the frequency of link and that good!,negative
"Very informative and interesting. Adapts the content to fit articles most read by you, as an individual.",positive
"Quora app is not working properly. I can't read the complete answers on mobile web browser. Quora is forcing me to read complete answers on mobile app. But, when I click on ""read more"" to expand the answer, nothing happens. I can't close pop-ups. Kindly check.",negative
"After the update on saturday, since then facing issues with views. After posting traffic has not been the same nd whatever on posts are updated late. Didnt expect this",negative
In terms of knowledge this has no challenge...but when it comes to user interface this app feels like a bulky one. So heavy to handle. thank you.,negative
I'm absolutely in love with quora for the past few years... Though people have started using it like Facebook with useless questions and answers but if we can skip that part it's really great indulgence... ‚ô•Ô∏è,positive
"Yeah a good platform,but need some change in catalog.Sometime unwanted error occurs but overall knowledgeable.",neutral
"The app is good.. but when opening feeds displayed on the screen that redirects to other site, the app screen flickers while dragging down through the content.. apart from that the app is great.",positive
"Great social media platform for sharing knowledge & thoughts. Still has some bugs I guess (for example, the app is closed whenever I added question) please improve it.",negative
"Lots of good questions, but a few silly ones. I do like cruising through and just reading. I feel you sometimes get more of a truthful answer than someone with an agenda.",positive
"What I liked about this app that how you can get any and every answer whether it is related to mathematical or your person life on this app. I am enjoying this a lot, great experience.",positive
It's an amazing platform that let's you learn from others experience and extract a lot of information about anything or everything.,positive
Quota is probably the most interesting site I have discovered to this point. Most of the questions and answers are very intelligent and I enjoy the interaction.,positive
Feed seems to be too much personalized at times I need a general content and it's difficult to find.,negative
I can't even use the website anymore because the advertising of this app keeps popping up and won't go away nor allow me to scroll through the content so I've simply been forced to download this app just to be able to read on quora...,negative
"I use Quora regularly. I've also installed this app on my previous phone, but decided against it on my new phone as I use Quora on my PC more often nowadays. I was forced to install this app to continue viewing an article (or view on PC). Your website is perfectly fine. I'm really annoyed I had to spend time to install your app, more time than it would've taken me to finish the article.",neutral
"So this a great and iformitave app where you can pretty much ask any question you want and you will receive an answer. The only problem I'm having with it is retarded moderation. The mods are either insanely biased or are just pure retards. I've had comments/ answers get taken down for absolutely no reason whatsoever. And that kind of ticks me off especially when I spent a good half hour typing it up. They dont give you a reason for why they took it down either, they just give you a notification that it was taken down because it ""violated there policy"" or something like that.",negative
This is an excellent application to learn new everyday. We can clear our doubts and ask questions which get answered within short time. Highly recommended for students who want to share their knowledge and learn more!,positive
They literally forced me into downloading the app. I was perfectly content with browsing through its website.,neutral
"The web site practically forced me to download the app by popping up the ad for it with no way to dismiss it, all the while promising a better experience, yet only showing me one answer per question. Frustrating web site, frustrating experience. Ugh! No thanks.",negative
"It forces me to download the app, even when I am logged in through a website on internet. And then I lose the question. So cheap!",negative
I found some bug that restarting the app and force close. Please fix this as soon as possible.,negative
This is an amazing App which I have used fundamentally for knowledge and learning in so many aspects. Love it. It is my knowledge base area.,positive
"No, I don't want your app. You track me enough in the browser. Remove your non dismissible popup",negative
horrible forced instalation with pop-up ... long time member at website and subscriber to the daily email post... this kind of design suggests a shift in philosophy and site ethic. this is the kind of bad faith gesture that makes me quit a subscription service and make Great Lengths to remove all permissions I've given you to work with any and all of my personal info.,negative
"One of the worse app ever, started as a good app and become one of the most biased app overtime and it's filter is soo bad that show you just limited and bad questions which are not even related to interest.",negative
"Being forced to download an app for something that works perfectly fine through the browser is disgusting. I'd like the freedom to choose how I approach the site. I'm immediately uninstalling the app, and I'll live without the site if I can't access it through the browser anymore. Not on.",negative
"It's one of the beautiful application where you can share feeling ,gain knowledge , write something which you are good at.",positive
Best app to study any topic from its best knowing. If you are confused about chusing any currier it is the best place you can get on your smartphone. But Web site really force to install the app. Alse it is good.,positive
"The app provides a great way to access the Quora platform on the go. It is very similar to the web version and works well. It would be great, however, if the developers could add the capability to be able to pinch zoom the content where the zoomed/magnified content would then auto wrap to fit the width of the screen i.e. adaptive in response to pinch zoom. This would hugely improve the readability, as currently the size of the text on the screen (especially the comments), is very small and hard to read and there is no way to increase the size to improve the readability.",positive
I m upset with this app when it is asking to update and not allowing to go inside. Everyone cant do immediate update so keep later option. Remaining everything is good.,negative
Why is Quora showing in Hindi? I need the English version while signing up. You can't keep a vernacular language without giving an option of converting it into English.,negative
forcibly made to use this laggy and unoptimized app. Even the mobile version of the site is better than this.,negative
This is more like a complaint... When the customer is using web app You guys force the user to install the mobile app This is bad because sometimes user does not want to install the app because he just wants to check out the app...,negative
"I started out on the website but it was super slow so I thought if I used the app instead it might be faster. It was slightly faster but lately it will time out or it'll just say ""something went wrong"". Nothing's really been working.",negative
"This app was working fine until a week or so ago,whenever I refresh my feed it keeps saying ""something went wrong"" or ""no stories"" and I need to know how to fix it.",negative
I was forced to install this app. Previously I was using quora website but nowadays a popup appears on the screen which force the user to install this app. Very bad üëé,negative
"Don't force the use of app, just let the website be accessible via smartphone. Happens every 2 months, you all bring a pop up on the browser and it's impossible to close the pop up. Just quit doing this useless thing",negative
This is full of waste. Very slow and buggy. Images will not load though we use high speed internet.need to improve a lot.,negative
"Not actually a feedback but a request. I mostly use quora late at night. Can we please have a night mode or black background display for viewing? Quora should have an option designed for those who prefer such displays. Hope my plea doesn't fall on deaf ears. Regards, A sincere Quoran :)",neutral
I really like this as a source of entertainment and gaining knowledge at the same time. It's a nice way to utilize time.,positive
"I enjoy reading opinions on current issues, though some comments are personal and of low taste. The App should make it easier to edit profiles and see answers written by others before I write mine.",neutral
"I think. It is a good platform to ask questions or get some suggestions,i like this app ,if you want to download the app then you may download this with ilno tension",positive
Don't know what happened suddenly the app is not working it just displays a white screen with no information,negative
"I enjoy the site because the level of conversation and debate is a lot higher than other sites I've seen. People use, on the whole, rational arguments and mostly do not denigrate the other side.",positive
It great only place I can tell the truth but wish it stop crashing had reinstalled least 10 times this month,positive
Good to get information. People ask random question a lot without any research. Propaganda are spread as well. There should be some way to decide credibility of answer.,negative
"The only reason I got this app was because while reading a post via email (something I've been able to do for months with no issue) it kept giving me a pop-up for the app. I was unable to close the pop-up or go back. I had to choose out of the email, go back in and reopon which usually brought me to the website with no issues. But now when I'm on the website to read something it blocks me from being able to read anything and just covers the majority of the screen in this impossible to ignore ad for the app. So I reluctantly download the app and it ahead me if I have a profile on quora, which I do. I log on and then it tells me to set up my profile! I can't do anything else until I set up a profile, which I had already done. Now I can't find the post I was trying to read! Very frustrating!",negative
"You can't view quora on the web. Everytime I try to read an article on Chrome for Android, after a bit of scrolling, I get a pop-up to install the app. The pop-up can't be dismissed. It is super annoying and makes me not want to use quora at all.",negative
"I like it very much but the app is getting bloated. It is sluggish in start and change. I can understand that ads are important but please try to limit to some, not many. Thanks",negative
"No, I don't want to buy the app. Just let me look off the website. The layout is confusing and overall rough. Just.....dont bother",negative
I already have enough apps on my phone I don't need to be forced to install more when I can use my web browser perfectly fine. I won't be installing the app and I won't be using quora any longer for this reason.,neutral
"I enjoy Quora as casual entertainment. Some of the questions are pretty mindless, and it's frustrating that on my phone I can't see a questioner's identity or personal information. Sometimes it would be relevant to know, eg, whether they're an adult or a teenager. But some of the interactions I've had have been enjoyable, and I've learned a few things. As a forum for debate I prefer it to Facebook.",negative
Too much steps to read an article. I mean it's mostly text for god sake so it shouldn't take forever to load and after loading halve the article it asks you to open on the app which is slow and sluggish.it was a good platform but now its not worth the effort to be honest.,negative
Was forced to install the app to continue reading the article. Nothing wrong with the website. Couldn't close the download prompt.,neutral
The popup that forces to download the app while trying to read a thread is the most disruptive gimmick I've seen in a while.,negative
It's very good to update the knowledge also to express our feelings expression and to interact with peopl,positive
Just wanted to read the article they sent me. Got partway through and then they wanted me to download app. I did. Then I couldn't use Google to read. They wanted me to log in with Facebook. Too much bullshit. Uninstalled the gimick app.ü§î,negative
Submitting answers takes too much time and always showing to answer questions of the same topic not getting mixed questions in to answer tab,negative
"its one of the boon in the age of social media. instead of those useless social media,everybody should use this app.. so informative and happening.",positive
I think it's very helpful in all sorts of areas. And at the same time maybe it can help me to be helpful as well.,positive
"I like the variety of questions. You name it, it's answered. Sometimes it involves personal bios, which can prove to be quite unexpected. Fun and entertaining.",positive
I've become very intrigued with reading various perspectives put forth in different answers to the same question. I equally love being sought out to answer questions. This is a well monitored site and the flow of the Q & As is fascinating.,positive
Stupid app I am forced to install to try and read an article. Now it won't recognise my sign in attempt either. I am now not using the app or website! Deleted and unsubscribed.,negative
Everything's fine. But can you please make night mode? Since i use quora mostly at night after work. Thank you:),positive
This app is very useful for every student. This app can help for every situation of our life. I learnt so much from this app by reading newsfeed and clarifed many doubts.. üëçü§ù,positive
Please work out the bug in messages bar. It doesn't open and directs me back to profile bar,negative
The new update brings a lot more links and ads which i find unnecessary and out of context.,negative
"This app used to work perfectly on my phone before update. It's a bit strange that I am constantly 'escorted' back to the 'Question For You' page while scrolling 'Requested Questions'. I also have a hard time clicking question which answer(s) seems legit to read. I decided to uninstall. Sorry, devs.",negative
"I think the app is actually decent, but my preferred way to read Quora in on my phone browser or from email. Now they force you to download the app to keep reading after a while with no way to continue. Seems like a shady way to drive up installs. Please change this back for those of us who like the web version and don't want another app.",negative
Forced download. I just want to check some answers on a website. I don't need a whole app for it. And no you're not having permission to see my photos.,negative
I need a help evrythg is showing in Hindi lang but I wanted in English so how can I change lang ??? Otherwise is is useful .,neutral
Please please pleeeease add night mode for the love of all that is great. I really need this added as my eyes gets a beating when I'm reading in the dark. Why is it so hard to make this happen? Please at least tell us the policy you apply for refusing us this feature.,negative
It has been a great place for me to find answers to any question for years. Now I have started answering other's questions once a while on topics that I am familiar with.,positive
"Finally. A social media app that isn't about brainless, moronic drivel. Very refreshing.",positive
Please check the bugs. It hangs very often nowadays. Doesn't update messages or credentials or knows about section on time.,negative
I don't want this app so please don't disturb me while I'm going through my feed. The app is no different than the web version and I absolutely hate apps like this. YOU ARE RUINING MY QUORA EXPERIENCE.,negative
"To access the ""bookmarks"" option, one has to swipe a lot to the left in the newer versions. Please make it as in the previous versions.",neutral
"Most of the time when I have searched for any topic like finance, technology etc it shows post on molestation or anything what they want to show",neutral
"So according to quora's logic, 11=infinity. I see in the ""Answer"" section 11 notifications. I think it's just 11 questions, let me see them and scroll down and it is endless",neutral
"I was reading a really interesting article on Quora web and a non-dismissable modal appears asking me to read it on the app. This does not go away away even after opening the article in a new browser instance. This is bullying and cheap tactics, wish there was a way to attach the screenshot. Goodbye Quora, it was nice knowing you.",negative
"It's very important for me to use this app for my neet preparation but it's keeps flagging me that I am not using my real name although I do and whenever I try to reach to the moderation policy it shows try again , it's soo much irritating that I will uninstall this app and ask others to do the same and never suggest someone to install the app because it is so damn frustrating",negative
Okay.. But it shall add more features like other Few apps. 1) Moreover it show me offline even when I'm in high internet connectivity area. 2) i hate pop ups nd adds which it show at times.,negative
"The app is good, but the algorithm keeps spitting out topics based on what you read once. It gets annoying reading the same thing",negative
If you love to read history or science articles you'll love this. I've never had so much reading material at my fingertips,positive
"My feed is 70% ads and 30% answers from people I follow. It wasn't like this before, so I don't use it as much now. Also, it doesn't let me access some options in my profile. Fix that, please.",negative
Its a good app to take some time to learn something new while on a trian or waiting in line somewhere.,positive
"The app update is horrible. Can't open any answer after a single click, have to press it multiple times and then the answer opens up multiple times! Please bring back the old seamless scroll.",negative
"I love Quora. It's a place I can go to to ask questions and get personalized honest answers even if I may not agree with all of them. It's a place I can go to share my experiences to help people who are going through something I already have so that they can have a place of hope and the knowledge that someone does care unlike an opposite experience I may have had. It makes me feel like I'm helping people which is how I want to spend my time. It's great to hear feedback from someone telling me my answer made a difference which is really all I try to do when I answer. Know that when I answer, I always try to answer with my heart.",positive
This an obnoxious and pandering app filled with forced prompts and failing sign ins. Were you to browse the site normally as you may have tried you will inevitably be met with a pop up you will not be able to get rid of until this trashy app is forced down your gullet and you pass over your personally identifying information. Scary.,negative
I can't use the website because it forces me to download the app. When I download the app it doesn't launch unless I provide access to my contacts what I will never do. This looks like a scam. Why are you doing this Quora? VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,negative
Location based service would enhance the count of app users say I am in Chennai I wanted to know something relevant to job search and tactics pertaining to particular location.,neutral
After installing i accidently connected yo my yahoo in my new phone instead of google.. now its not allowing me to connect thru my google account. tried uninstalling and reinstalling.. app is designed to be smart.. still retains my yahoo selection..,negative
"Change the font. This new updated font is very bad. The earlier font was better. Also keep a uniform font. Some part is in a different font, the rest in some other font. It feels irritating.",negative
Quora is the best .the analysis is super.quora is addictive.perfect for learning.love QUORA. bestest article .very readable and shareable.üëç,positive
It's an amazing experience being on quora it helped me to see the world with a different and wonderful mindset.,positive
It could be better if you provide features of who viewed our answers. Rest it is pleasing,neutral
I like App very much but it is very slow and it is difficult to attach pictures to question,negative
"My favorite app, but as being a huge fan of Quora...i would love the app interface if it's as easier as Facebook is...because sometimes notifications are not appeared..and many other errors in the app... it's comments section is too confusing..so, i wish the Quora developer's read my review and make this changes as i mentioned.. Thanks üôÇ",positive
It's bad form to force users to use the app to access all content on the website. I have enough apps. I don't need an app for every website.,negative
"Until they stop making this app mandatory to use quora for more than a couple lines of text on mobile, my review will remain 1 star. There's nothing wrong with the app or Quora as a company (aside from the app being forced on me) and I tend to enjoy my time on Quora. It's recommended for a good laugh, or for a couple story times.",neutral
Very informative and fun! Easy to use and navigate. Gay Friendly.,positive
Simple UI and functionality but doesn't make it less efficient. Very responsive design with minimal data use because it's mostly just text and ideas shared on the platform.,positive
"One of the best app I've come across, for detailed helpful answers and suggestions from a bunch of people willing to help you out with your questions.",positive
The settings of this app suddenly changed to Hindi language. Quora equates Hindi with India. Disgusting app. Doesn't even know India is a land of diversity.,negative
"My app and web account have both changed to Hindi all of a sudden, without me having authorised the change. I do not understand the language and cannot read it either. Please change it back to English, and stop with the gross generalisation of all Indians. Thank You.",negative
I am very annoyed with quora. Someone has changed the English interface to Bengali. When I tried to change the language back to English I discovered English is still my language but that the characters are Indian characters. I cannot use the app like this.,negative
I'm not even from India and Quora think it's a good idea to change my language setting to India language. This app is become worse.,negative
"I have been using Quora for a while now, and usually it's great (even if it kills my battery!) But now the whole UI is in a language I don't even recognise let alone understand! What happened to the English UI?!!!",negative
"Great app, but suddenly changed to Hindi language. I have never used Hindi language in the app at all. Couldn't find settings as because all of sudden everything is in Hindi... hoping uninstalling and installing it again will help....",negative
Quora is now unusable since the language on it has become unrecognizable. Expect to see a massive drop in popularity and activity on Quora until it's changed back to English.,negative
Very slow app. Shows error 404 very often. Some of answers are getting downvoted through my profile(And I have not even seen most of them). Some answers are upvoted and downvoted at the same time. Sometimes Quora Hindi opens automatically and can't get back to English.,negative
It itself changed interface language to hindi.I tried changing to English but it seems doesn't work,negative
"Why did Quora's language suddenly change to Hindi? Even though I try to change it back to English, the language is still Hindi. Please fix this. I don't know if this is a bug. I just experienced this. (11-28-18).",negative
Suddenly everything is displayed in Hindi even though English is set as default.,neutral
I loved the web site but I am being forced to install the app because of annoying pop ups on the site forcing me to the app,negative
"Awesome app.Just one minor issue,there should be a way to access all the answers i have ever liked.it is not possible to bookmark everything i like.App is good,just rating minimu to get attention for feedback.",positive
Really enjoy the intellectual quality of the discussions on this site. Really got tired of the pictures of puppies and kittens on Facebook and constantly being asked to wish someone Happy Birthday all the time. This site is so much more informative without the silly memes and endless screaming matches.,positive
"I have had this app installed for some time. I have now decided to review it due to recent changes. Quora was amazing! I used it all the time. That is when I needed an app for easy access. Sure enough, there was an app. It was just like the desktop site but with a material themed layout. Everything worked perfectly. Then, the app updated it's interface, which I did not like at all. Further more, it gave me connection errors A LOT after this update and this DOES NOT happen on the desktop version from my phone either on wifi OR mobile data. Then, Quora decided to remove question details. This may not be related to the app but it severely discourages the use of Quora and it's app for me. Also, no update notes? For the past 3 updates there has been no update notes so I have no idea what you added or fixed in the latest update. Not cool Quora! You let me down.",positive
If you love giving thoughtful answers only to have the application freeze more than it doesn't then you'll love quora. You'll get more done and more questions answered with a piece of chalk and a sidewalk then you will trying to type on quora the slowest most freezing application I've seen and I've only been using computer since 1988,positive
"This app is a unique platform, where people share their diverse views and experiences... amazing... I love it.",positive
"Interesting, entertaining and requires some concentration and consideration (of others). A well thought out game for modern times*. One star lost for repetitiousness - of both questions And answers.",positive
Really nice and educational application. I'm giving it 4 stars because it needs a new feature to put bookmarked answers in different folders,positive
Overall its a very nice app. Easy to work with. Never hangs. Has got relavent and updated content.,positive
"It's great... U will get to learn new things daily... Ur knowledge will expand... U will enjoy it... Make sure to use message privacy else that can be a trouble, other than that it's just awesome if u love to read and write.... If u r an introvert, believe me u r going to find quora a very good friends of yours.....",positive
"I have high speed internet, still this app show no internet connection or images are not loading.",negative
When logged in...it asked me to add Hindi and said English will be my default. But everything was changed to Hindi. Then I tried disabling the hindi language it failed miserably. The button doesn't work,negative
It's the best application where you can get you answer. It features a great UI and easy to use interface.,positive
1st of all Quora itself has a lot is issues with regards to tags. Coming to the app it has a huge flaw with typing input. Google Voice Typing doesn't work well with this app.,negative
Best app. I stopped watching videos on youtube i stopped surfing my free time on fb and insta. I love to read on quora. Its best and enhance your knowledge .,positive
Finally its back in English. All is good with the world. One of the best apps to spend time on.,positive
"The app is informative. But it contains a lot of ad. The most annoying thing about this app is that, it has added a lot of features, which cover almost bottom part of app. Almost 1 inch is covered by the features, which should not be here.",negative
"It's preety amazing specially when you are depressed have had many troubles going on in your life.The moment you step in Quora you read different articles written by some amazing people,get advices, read out the experiences shared by a great number of people.It calms you alot.when you read about that it's not only me who has problems.I personally just like Quora alot.Ans yes you learn alot from here:)",positive
After recent update they totally changed the UI. It got messy. Hindi language wasn't needed. Takes about half an hour to load even after connecting to wifi. They ruined the app for users.,negative
Sucks . And all the thing on quora is useless nowadays. I was reading on chrome and it kept interrupting to download app. Take 1 star for that,negative
"I was not keen on using this app after going through the reviews. I installed it however because the previously mobile-friendly website had started displaying the ""download the free app"" message that prevented using the site. I had a faint glimmer of hope for an ok-ish experience, but no... I'm writing this review while waiting for the app to open. Not cool, Quora.",negative
I just instaled the app on my new phone and I tried logging in with facebook (like I always do) and it keeps logging in with someone else's facebook account. I don't even know who that person is. How am I supposed to use the app????,negative
I love browsing through the site sometimes for about an hour but when I get an email with a question I'm interested in I shouldn't get half way don't the page reading answers and have a pop up to download the app with no way to get rid of it.,negative
This is a platform for people to write something to express their feeling and share their thoughts which is cool and fascinating.,positive
"Very good application, where we can increase our wisdom and learn how to use the time so productively.",positive
Well I have to rate this 1* as it is not working on MI Pad after update. I mostly read quora on my tablet and now this app only taking space. Very dissatisfied. I will change my rating to 5* once it starts supporting.,negative
This app is not responding at all and it is leading to auto switch off and hanging no. of times. Got irritated!...,negative
Guys please please please make it more faster for use it's really killing my patience with its slow progress and I'm really fed up sometimes make it more easier for usage!!!!!!,negative
A very useful app for knowledge. There are answers to thousands of questions and our doubts are solved pretty much easily. But a few glitches- the answer writing experience is not very smooth. And sometimes it gets stuck. Other than that it is a good app,positive
App feels like quora mobile website integrated into webview. It doesn't feel like native app at all. Being mostly text only content you would expect it to load faster on slow internet connections but it loads slower than reddit which even loads gifs faster than it takes this app to load the homepage.,negative
It's very informative. But even I have your app you are sending me same data on my email. Will you stop email please.,neutral
Great App! Very informative and interesting. No hype. Ads are not intrusive. Plus it's a great opportunity to make a little extra money.,positive
"Without a browsing history section, this awesome app deserves 1 star. It's a challenge to find the answer that you have read few hours back.",positive
The app used to be great ...i have no problem with advertisements..but showing same answers and links whenever i open my app is irritating.kindly fix this,negative
The app seems to get unresponsive at times and I've had to uninstall and reinstall it. I don't know if that happens to anyone else. It's quite inconvenient.,negative
Very disgusting and annoying Pop ups continue to appear also on the online website. I just loved this platform but right now it's being really irritating.,negative
"The app always, always crashes whenever I try to post an answer or comment. It's really annoying. For a Q&A app, it's the most trashiest ever, with it's never ending amount of bugs. Neither does the website does any better.",negative
"You won't allow an article to be read fully on mobile version of any browser? You ask at the near climax of the article to open in app. I just don't like to fill my phone with apps, but wanted to read articles on browser, you are seriously stupid in suggesting app for your website",negative
Worse than a browser. If they're going to force me to use a mobile app instead of a browser it should be a better experience.,negative
Just trying to read Quora on my phone and this stupid app is basically trying to force me to download it. I get halfway through reading a post and it just comes up in the middle of the screen advertising it and blocks my view.,negative
"I enjoy reading Quora. It's fun and informative...However I have the app one star because I made a decision to limit the apps on my phone by using web pages thus saving memory and spacethat the app uses. Quora is a classic example of an ""unneeded app""...useful but not necessary. I discovered tough that it IS ""necessary""...because after about sixty seconds a pop-up appears telling me to use the app! It appears to be immovable by any means except leaving the page and then starting over. Perhaps that is not the case but if there is no x to immediately close it than that's pretty crappy. Any app that I am ""forced"" to use when I don't want to will get a 1 star. Even if I do like it.",positive
There is problem in this app. The topic is which I am following is only written as a heading and a different topic page is showing in that place.,negative
Quora is a nice way to interact with people and we can learn many things in this process. We can spend time usefully rather than watching serials in television.,positive
"I do not enjoy the fact that when I get an email from quora to look at a question on the web app, it forces me to look at a screen I cannot exit out of unless I completely close the web app. It says, ""There is more in the app. Download the app please or something like that."" I do not enjoy that, and it discourages me from using it again. Stop forcing your users to download the mobile application.",negative
Really just an overall nuisance. I just wanted to read everything on the internet but every now and then it forced me to use the app. It shows how desperate the website is to shove people into an ad driven app these people are. Have some confidence in your platform instead of forcefeeding garbage. I hope someone else just copies the idea and keeps it simple and not run by greed. It's a shame people spend their time and intelligence using Quora only to be undersold by ignorant people trying to take advantage of readers.,negative
Can't even browse in chrome it keeps asking to download app.. And guess wht! The app is crashing,negative
one star because your app security was breached which may have leaked my personal mailid. account deleted . uninstalled app and searching for a new forum.,negative
"Advised my account has been hacked this morning. Quora says it has sent me an email to reset my details, but none has arrived (even after several requests to email me the link). Come on, Quora. You can do better than this. :(",negative
Liked it until I got email about someone hacking their system 12/4/18 an user's info is compromised!!! So I cancelled!!,negative
"The website made me download the app to keep browsing (popup wouldn't let me keep reading my feed). When I click 'open in app' on the website it takes me to a different part of my feed instead of letting me continue where I was. Sometimes I read half an answer and it makes me go to the app and I can't find it again. Today I can't log in, it asks to reset password but I haven't received the email with the reset link. Finally I am done with this site - delete app and unsubscribe. I have never had this issue with another app so this whole thing baffles me.",negative
"I was continuously redirected to a page to install the app in order to get best experience. Why force your readers. That just aggravates the situation and made me hate the app right away. To top it off, the app never worked because it would not connect to internet but the other apps and browser did.",negative
"An app that has integrations with Facebook, Twitter, etc and yet can't maintain security standards is dangerous. Had to delete my account.",negative
"Used to work fine. However, a recent update seems to have broke it because I just get a white screen upon launching it. Already tried clearing storage/cache and reinstalling it.",negative
"Even though I have high speed WiFi, the feed just keeps on loading. And now I wonder what was the update about. Please fix it",negative
Give a Black or night mode option. Hard to read with white background.,neutral
"I can't open up answers and read them fully. Also, I can't use the damn browser because it won't let me.",negative
"Hey quora.inc, your app is amazing, I'm so addicted to it, I'm a quoran and a reader as well :D. Lately after the recent update the app is misbehaving and stating ""505 error"". My wifi is fine and my phone too, but I just couldn't get off of the obsession I have towards the app. Can't figure what the problem is, it doesn't let me in for like 6/10 per day. :( Plox halp.",positive
I love to read what other people write! I find doing so is both very relaxing and invigorating.,positive
"It's a great site but the app has some loading issues. It randomly crashes, is unable to load ""more answers"" tab, and only brings up headlines without the answers underneath even though I can see them before I click. Weird problems. Wish it was better because I love this site.",negative
"I enjoy the Q&A content from the readers of Quora. I understand the need to monetize but Quora is obnoxious in how they block you from reading content after reading an unknown number of articles. Quora, you're not the NYTimes. You don't have journalists on staff to pay, so don't throw your site behind a paywall by making me download your app so you montetize my private info, like location and contact data.",neutral
"It makes me uneasy, being asked about my spam and if I clean it and how easy someone can hack my email. It's weird. I deleted it",negative
you just stealed a lot of attention time to others social media by making me discover your website and app. I hope you will continue to make good usage of it. Your app is really great and I love it but a tunable auto-scroll param for reading long answers will be such a great feature to implement. It will allows me to read while eating my oatmeal during the morning without touching my phone ! ;-),positive
This is the best app and just what I have been looking for. It helps a lot especially as it gives me satisfactory answers to all my worries. The best place to learn. It doesn't even contain ads that disturb. I love the app.,positive
Awesome app for networking and knowing people around the world. Certainly much better use of time than spending on Instagram and Facebook.,positive
It's an interesting app... many questions from people who are seeking advice.. comments are intriguing ...the advice offered by so many people. ... I enjoy reading the comments...,positive
"Bug Spotted! After updating the app and selecting use another account, app is scanning for device credentials and asking to enter password... nope.. won't do that.. major disliking factor.. seems like no control on privacy, safety and security.. please improve..",negative
"It seems to be going downhill wrt quality and excessive ads, but still a valuable resource I use often.",negative
Good app. Holds your interest. Is updated regularly. Excellent support offered.,positive
"This is a great way to efficiently ask and answer questions. It works well as an app, and is great for getting notifications when your questions are answered.",positive
"Very good app! Nice to see what people are interested with and the answers to the questions, Excellent!",positive
"too many ads. i know they have got to survive but the ads make it very hard to separate content from ads, which is probably the intent. keep up the bad work, your product strategies will force you guys out of business soon. there's better information elsewhere without the ad pollution.",negative
"I loved this app when I found it a few years ago. That's before the updates, it's now crowded with ads and shared questions from the people you follow. My feed is nothing but garbage questions from trolls that post links to external sites and ads. A year or two ago I would have recommended this to any and all my friends. Now sadly, I avoid the site and deleted the app.",negative
Can't read it in a browser anymore because of your annoying pop-up about downloading the app. The app repeatedly has an error mesade so can't read it there either.,negative
"It's a great platform to share opinions and knowledge. We will learn a lot. But, it's GUI is not so great.",positive
Whenever I go to requests tab it automatically keeps switching to for you tab which is very annoying. Same is the case when I go to stats section in you tab. Please fix this ASAP its very annoying.,negative
"A great platform for getting and sharing ideas , experiences and many more !!!",positive
"I uninstalled Quora for the sake of my own sanity. The icon continues to show 1 notification. Yet, when I open the app there is nothing new.",negative
Amazing app . Very informative and I can contribute ideas. Lots of new information everyday..like a school within your phone üëåüëåüëå,positive
"Thanks to your data breach, I'm now not able to login to my account nor able to recover. Submitting the recovery request has also not helped",negative
"Irrelevant and too many ads, News articles disguised as answers. Circlejerk, repetitive answers, click bait pictures by top writers, who have no business answering particular questions.",negative
Very good app for learning and sharing there are many people who will answer a question you posted .Interactive way for learning and clarifying our doubts within seconds,positive
"I don't have the right word to describe Quora. I think it's a part of the internet closer to reality. It isn't a place where you can post memes and random pics, it's got some strong content and is really just wonderful. Will restore your faith in humanity",positive
This application lags after using it for a long time and sometimes images in a post does not load.,negative
"I had this app for years. Then needed to uninstall it as the phone was getting old, and slow. I thought I could always keep reading Quora on the site. But No! Quora won't let you read on mobile browsers. An annoying popup comes up asking to install the app, and it can't be cancelled. The app itself isn't great, but it is functional. This one star rating is for not letting mobile users access content without downloading the app.",negative
"Good one, but i think there should be a premium version of quora where the articles or the question answered are top notch written by top writers and people are willing to pay to read those.. A business idea it is, cannot ignore need of a platform where there are good content... üëçüòä",positive
I loved this app when it was initially released in 2008. The quality of answers these days isn't like how it used to be back then. Advertising on this platform is seriously a sick thing to do.,negative
"Being forced to download this really really bad app is an insult. Quora, I'm tempted to delete my account. I'd get some time back to boot. Before you switch to an app only model make sure your app is better than the site in a web browser. Right now it isn't.",negative
"This is good but I do have ui pointer. I think the bottom popup asking if an answer was useful to you just as you open the answer is annoying and intrusive. I want to use my screen to read the answer not to see a question about the text that I've barely finished reading. I clicked no before realizing what I was doing and I suspect other users will similarly do this, thinking the message banner is a Wheaton about whether they want to commit to something etc... Not meaning to sound like I'm ranting, I an just trying to convey the confusing nature of the UI flow... Thanks and keep up the good work.",negative
I m getting answers for every single topic here. This is the best app for information and discussion on most of the topic including current affairs.,positive
"Not so sure about this one anymore. The recent breech in security is disconcerting. Maybe time to move on. I am leaving my 5 star review, because I really did used to enjoy the app quite often.",negative
This review reflects the fact that quora forces one to use the app instead of simply using their webpage. This is rude and stupid. So I erased the app and recommend you do the same. I can live with the constant pop-up telling me to download the app regardless of how rude Quora is for stooping so low,negative
"It helps us to understand various topics at student level, so it's really helping me",positive
They change the language to french without even asking and i didn't find any option to change it,negative
"Awesomest! Just love this app. I mean it really stands out in a group of social media platforms. Really informative and unlike others, not a time waste.",positive
"Hate this whenever am trying read in google web page one disturbanced pop up notification is coming ""download the app"" there is no option to get rid of this pop up..of quora n insatlled just to report",negative
All good but some times gets loaded and loaded and loaded though i have strong Internet connection and finally pops -404error-. Pls try to fix this.,negative
Good App. But does not bring any additional functionality other than just opening the website.,negative
I was in the middle of constructing an important question in the online version when I was forced to download the app and it erased all of my work.,negative
"Awesome app. I can get answers to almost all my questions related to studies, career, etc.",positive
"They don't let you read answers anymore on google chrome despite logging in and risking my data with these idiots, they want me to download the app and read answera or they'll let me read half answer and fhen give a pop-up of app. Brilliant.",negative
I find it absolutely appalling that you prevent users on mobile phones from accessing the website via browsers.,negative
"Best app to learn about various aspect of life,it motivates,improve knowledge,clear doubt over all an all rounder",positive
"Useful app for one who have curiosity to know about thing, one who to explore and one who want to share their views.For such this one is the good platform.",positive
"I used to love reading Quora for all the great information that is shared. Recently the website has been popping up unclosable windows forcing users to install the app. My phone is almost full so I installed it temporarily to give it one star, and off to Reddit I go.",positive
"This app works very slowly and it's damn boring. People ask such stupid questions! They can as well find it on Google. I still see no sense in it. It's an app where everyone's just trying to act smarter than the rest. People boasting about their education qualifications, handwriting,etc.",negative
"Love this page. I hadn't even read the rules or guidelines yet and I answered a question with a few paragraphs and it got almost 600k views and 5k upvotes in 2 days. If you can write well and have a particular ability in a certain topic, you'll love it.",positive
"Forced now to download the app. Not liking this, should be a choice. I have enough apps taking up limited space on my device. I don't need another. The web client was fine, might even unsubscribe as I will NOT download an app forced on me. Update: December 10, 2018 being forced to download app again. I am now unsubscribing from emails as the don't listen to their audience....",negative
"Great platform to gain general knowledge, can get awareness of a particular topic from different people around the world...and lot more..",positive
It was all good till they introduced news articles on the Homepage. It'd be better if you created a different section for that.,negative
Good light and easy app with smooth ui. Works well with almost any device...great platform for knowledge exchange,positive
I use Quora as one of my primary information sources (other being Wikipedia). I like the format and the discourse is generally balanced and mentally stimulating. However some topics discussed here are either downright silly or deliberately Provocative to divert feedbavj away from a a good discussion. Suggest some moderation.,positive
"Very good app. Only request to the developers is, please add a dark mode. It gets difficult reading in darker vicinities",positive
Its a best app to spend some time on instead of scrolling facebook feed. Use it at your own risk it can literally change your perspective towards the world.,positive
"It's very disappointing of Quora not including Telugu as one of the languages though it has included Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Mararti !! Telugu is the second largest spoken language in India and third largest of the Indian languages.",negative
Lots of advertisment distracts and confuses a user atleast me personaly. Is an absolutely amazing idea. Super proud of it. But needs to make it more organised ..user should not get jumbled sentences about their contents,positive
"It's the most suitable and useful site I have come across, just the collapsing thing should be reconsidered.",positive
"The app needs too much internet, they should have an option like facebook lite or something that is faster, reading on the website is way easier, 50% of the time that I try to read an answer in the app it just says No Internet, or the screen is just blank, but then I open the same answer on the website and it works perfectly.",negative
I love this app so much. Not only does it make you learn new things but you get to learn true stories from other user which is exciting.,positive
Great platform where anyone can put his/her views..must be used by every student. U ll learn a lot,positive
"New update is not good.heavy data usage,image loading speed very slow even on 4g,we need lite version for this",negative
"The new update is absolutely atrocious. I literally unfollowed every single topic on my profile because I didn't like the new notifications getting spammed on my homepage, but Quora didn't stop there. No. Now even if you unfollow every single topic, they'll spam you with notifications to subscribe to new ones. There should be an option to disable this. Constantly pushing notifications kills battery, makes the app lag, and disinterests me.",negative
The interface should be better. Though the simplicity should be maintained.,neutral
"I get vast information on any subject I intend to know. Though there are some annoying sex matters, totally the best app to immerse in it.",positive
it's really good because it helps people see what other people's opinions are and it also has a lot of good questions and answers. overall I think u should really try this app and see for yourself.,positive
"Great app, except for the fact that the people who ANSWER the questions are easily mistaken for those that ASK the questions, leading to some very confusing comments. This needs to be fixed. Right below the question is the name of the person who answered it, NOT the one who asked it. Fix this and it's easily 5 stars",negative
"I love using Quora, I learn about new things and at the same time also share my own thoughts and such and people like what I write. Only issue I have with the app is, when your adding a question the navigation for 'Next' or 'Add' or 'Done' is a bit broken... You should be able to type your questions and add topic and request swiftly like before.. Now I have to type question, add topic, then go back and back and then request answers. Maybe the devs need to check that.",positive
"I will just say, It is fantastic, people here are fantastic, knowledge they share here are fantastic. Keep making it better.",positive
WHERE ARE THE BOOKMARKS?? Basic software engineering good practices mandate good navigatibility and I have to say you guys make it really hard for us with your counterintuitive component placement,negative
"Helpful or diverting , I don't care. It's fun to read and consider how smart some people are and how dumber than a tree stump others appear to.be.",negative
"First of all, stop pestering me to install the app when viewing the mobile site. The mobile site does the exact same thing as the app. Secondly, please stop showing me the same promoted articles when I do not click on them. I've scrolled past the same promoted article 5 times in about a minute. Other than that, the app works as intended. However, Quota has become riddled with ads and promoted articles, up to the point where I don't even bother to read anything outside of my daily digest.",negative
Content are good but the app is very poor. They keep making many major changes almost every release which hampers user experience.,negative
"First of all, this is one of the best platforms to gain or share your experiences, thoughts,and secondly,as usual, you get different types of concepts, business strategy from successful personality in those respective sectors.... In one word to say,using this app , felt astounding....",positive
"The standard of quora is deteriorated. Now they force you to install app everytime you open it in browser. Completely nonsense app which spams you with unnecessary notifications. Well done quora management team, you destroyed one of the best apps.",negative
Why the app is slow? ... From the past two days it's getting disconnected... Connection time out error,negative
Latest update sucks. I can only see the thumbnail of the topics I subscribed. Previously I used to see the name of the topic I followed on the footer end.,negative
I hate this app. Once written a question with some grammatical/meaning mistake I cannot edit it. The question gets on reverting back and app asks me to thank them for making my question meaningless. Very annoying app,negative
Amazing app where you get to learn a lot from other experiences and even you can share you can experiences. Kudos.,positive
I downloaded it because the website forced me to if I wanted to finish reading. People have limited storage just in case you didn't know and chrome works just fine on mobile.,positive
Its very easy and useful app to help us know (almost) the appropriate answers for the basic questions in different topics.,positive
Good app overall. I asked a simple question and got hit back immediately with very thorogh and detailed answers. Love it.,positive
"Continual annoying emails with no unsubscribe option. Also, their useless data security has apparentpy allowed my password and personal details to be leaked. DELETED",negative
"I only downloaded this app because I wasn't allowed to do anything but that if I went on your website, I already had a similar situation with making an account beforehand. Stop nagging!",negative
Came across it by lucky chance. It raises various topics and people's thoughts on them. In short; interesting.,positive
It's ridiculous that I have to delete an app to download this app just so I can continue reading and posting answers. Totally deleting this app after reading a few more query entries that interest me.,negative
"I kept being pestered while using Quota online to download the app. The pop-up gave no clear method of how to close it, and I couldn't comment until I downloaded it. Change your ads so that I do not become holed into an advertisement that forces me to leave my current page just to leave the advertisement. Maybe then I might possibly consider keeping your app installed and/or changing the 1 star rating. I will not be bullied or pestered into downloading an app that does the exact same thing as an internet page.",negative
If you ever plan to add dark mode to this app then will you be able to make it similar to that what Twitter has. Ashen grey with a purple tint. Or maybe consider to give us an option to choose gradient and color hue/scheme. Thank you in advance,neutral
A very knowledgeable app. Which provides a practical knowledge and experience provided by experienced people. I suggest to all people in this world to use this app.,positive
its a very useful app for beginners of every aspirants..also it helps every type of query which are related to any kind of subject and general necessary doubts,positive
"Good app.Contains lot of information.Many people around world share their ideas through this app that may be anything. this is the first i'm writing review because i loved it alot .It helped me a lot in information gathering&different ideas of different people about a particular topic. I'm sure it is one of the greatest app.In this anyone can able to share their knowledge,personal experiences also.",positive
Easy and fast way to know the experience of others in any field u mention.,neutral
"Quora only allows you to browse the page for a few minutes before it literally decides to force you to download the app with a banner that won't go away. Great technique guys. It's like Yahoo answers had an annoying younger brother that said ""pick me!""",negative
"The website is good, and the UI is fine. The app kills my battery and has a confusing UI.",positive
"There are many interesting articles on Quora, but I seem to be getting only a limited variety of topics in those articles, which are presented to me....",positive
Add a option to change font size! text size is too small by default :(,negative
"Quora has been my consistent addiction for the last few years. The UI is good, awesome contents get published every now & then by talented writers.... It has rightfully become one of the favourite pastimes of the day",positive
The new update was literally ridiculous....I couldn't follow the topic which was already following.. everything got disconnected....their showing ridiculous useless topics ....not at all liking.....this s first time am giving comment for app ....,negative
"All is fine but there is a problem about which I have reported team quora many times but no action has been taken . I could not find any of my asked questions and not even my recently asked question . Every time of reporting team quora , I just recives a similar mail and no solution of the problem after that . That's the reason of giving one star less . Otherwise it's a good app.",negative
A must have app it was . But now it has become marketing adda. Each and everyone is there to just advertise.,negative
Its completely awesome I love this app I recommend it to anybody who likes to write about all kinds of different subjects.,positive
This is a great social media platform to get yourself clear with countless answers of infinitely many questions. I love it. But there are some issues regarding to it's up votes and states. It won't refresh or sometimes it just falls for no reason. I assume this will be solved with just an update.,positive
"I really like this App and its tools to styles and organize my answers, yet since the last update i'm missing a feature where i could select any text and use the link button to convert it into a hyperlink instead of just pasting the link and use whatever name it would give me automatically.. Can u bring this feature back please..?",neutral
"Really its a useful app.U can read stories from other people,which r inspiring.U can expand ur knowledge here.Truly motivating.",positive
"The app version of the great site is quite easy to use and search so far. The homescreen widget is an added plus. I wish there was a multi-tabbed app interface, but all in all, very good site-app conversion.",positive
"not able to see my messages anywhere, not on desktop website nor on Android app! and on desktop website, even not able to get to my profile, it's redirecting to home page of quora!",negative
A very awesome app for free time for the people who loved to read. It's amazing.,positive
The latest version of Quora is not functioning for my Samsung S9. Please revert to the previous versions thank you. Problems encountered 1.) Page does not load 2.) The Back/Return button does not perform as expected and only provided feedback(vibrations) Tried reinstalling the app but is ineffective .,negative
"""Cannot connect to the internet"" despite a fully functioning connection every other downloaded app uses seamlessly.",negative
this was a good app in past but after recent updates it nothing more than trash because it keeps on crashing again and again for no reason,negative
Great app.....its a unique app to gather knowlege about any thing. This app is a boon for any person who is fond of reading books on different random topics.,positive
"absolutely terrible, not only do you prevent material from being read but your only option to do so ""open app"" doesn't work nor does the x to remove from screen. you're not going to funnel me",negative
There are some issues in this last update. The app doesn't let you read a post and redirect you to the home page to see the new Space (collections) and the exit/delete button at Space card doesn't work as well.,negative
"The app always heads straight back to the top whenever I tap an article, even if I scrolled down to the bottom. This makes the app unusuable, since I can't even open the articles I want to read.",negative
It's a really great app. It's easy to use. It's really great if you're needing to ask questions. And you get to answer questions yourself. It's really fun. I spend a lot of my time on this app.,positive
Latest update is pretty bad. No option to turn off the annoying feeds section which comes up in home. Considerably reduces the amount of screen space. Funny how a reading app has less screen space than Facebook XD. Updated version is crappy on mobile Internet.,negative
Why dont you let us read the content in our mobile browser. This is really disgusting. whenever i try to read something using chrome a popup blocks the entire screen asking me to download the app.,negative
"quora is so annoying. First the website made me choose at least 10 interests just to read the answers to a single question. then it started sending me this ""digest"" I wasn't interested in. once I look at the digest email and see something I want to read, it makes me download the app to continue reading. so yeah, I downloaded the app, but the bad review is for basically forcing me to. now it's probably going to MAKE me review it, too. do better. üôÑ",negative
You cannot force me to download your app when i am reading in the browser mode. This is ridiculous!,negative
filled with loads of advertisements and unnecessary stuff updates have ruined the previous clean and user friendly approach.,negative
"Beautiful dashboard, very simple interface, easy to navigate, cool community of people. I love it hands down!!!",positive
i always cant open the link after clicking. but i can open the link in browser.,neutral
"I have not and never will install this app. I don't use quora enough to warrant installing an app, but I did occasionally go on online to read stuff, but I can't even do that without it covering my screen with a thing I can't even close telling me to install the app. I DO NOT WANT THE STUPID APP. I have deleted my account because if you aren't willing to let mobile users go onto your website without you harassing them to install your app, you don't deserve my business.",negative
"very informative, feels us like reading magazines , keep us aware of current affairs all over the world.",positive
Can't read quora on browser as it keeps prompting to install app and the pop up cannot be closed. Have not installed app due to shortage of memory space. Hence I can't use quora now. GREAT.,negative
it's amazing application to sharing information & knowledge as well it is impaccble. i appreciate to the quora which gives us a such kind platform to gain knowledge.,positive
Works pretty doggone well. Not every question has a satisfying answer. or even answered. But the formulating of a good question can provide one insight.,positive
"The Quora community is a very healthy, safe place to express yourself and to get honest advice and feedback. You can get answers from a wide variety of people from different backgrounds, ages, education levels, and life experiences. Would recommend to anyone who likes to read and/or write.",positive
"This is the best interesting app by far, one that you can actually ask questions and get answers from different people, and you can also answer questions and many more. for me five üåü is too small ten star quora all the way üëç up",positive
very slow and outdated features. needs a lot of improvements,negative
Do not appreciate being forced to update ! I now have to block notifications from quora. It was fine for me the way it was.,negative
"i used to love Quora, then there was an update that made it so it was hit or miss as to whether it would start or not (90% of the time i get a blank screen and nothing else). Frustrating when all I want to do is find out pointless opinions.",negative
Very confusing. Everytime I tried to type a question it kept telling me to add link. Link to what? And theres no help thing either.,negative
"When we write a question, it asks for editing multiple times which is annoying. If the question really needs editing, let it suggest which sentence or words needs to be changed.",negative
It will be good if we can capture the photo of our questions to ask anyone. Sometimes the mathematical symbols are not written properly.,neutral
its very good app..because here we can look at the knowledges and skills and experiences of the people who has gone through any subject..,positive
Forcing to download the app by showing full screen popup on mobile website with no option to disable would not Work.,negative
It is an excellent app. It saves data and is my first go-to source for any question.,positive
"I don't understand why is the website FORCING you to download the app even though you can get a good enough experience via browser. every time I want to use quora I have to install, later uninstall due to low memory. and maybe, I just don't use this service often enough to justify its use of my scarce resources. (seriously. once in 2 months. annoying stuff, folks.)",negative
A popup on Chrome forces me here to install the app in order to continue to read an answer. I don't need this app.,negative
Quora is indeed beneficial it is Knowledge on call ! We humans like to ask questions as well as respond to questions and it is a learning experiance for both. Great feeling .,positive
very good app.. very informative.. very addictive.. we can select intrests of our choice.. and explore our intrests.. nice concept.. nice app..,positive
Sometimes doesn't respond and quora won't let me use its Web site and force me to use its app instead which is hellishly laggy and buggy. I have to tap on 'read more' so many times to get it respond.,negative
i am not able to login to my previous account. it asked for signup created a new account with the same email.,negative
"Their website is now unusable on mobile, with a big pop-up saying to download the mobile app. You can't dismiss it or anything. So not only will I not download the app, but I'm going to quit using the site altogether... And I was very active in their, answering a lot of questions.",negative
Friggin annoying user journey to read a single answer. Must be for all that data they keep about your activity only to let it leak like a faucet.,negative
Great app that is actually useful unlike most other social media sites and apps. Bring up a question you have and get it answered by many people. Even help out others by answeeing their questions. 5 stars,positive
"Was bombarded severally to download app each time i read from the website. When installed it only would open to a blank page. I should have given it a zero star, if only that option was possible.",negative
a really great place to learn and catch up on any cool topics that might interest you. highly recommended,positive
quora is the best thing to happen to my life. the app is user friendly and I've never experienced a glitch,positive
"The Quora app takes a lot of time to open, in spite of a good connection speed. I get a speed of 2kbps while using Quora, and more than 200kbps otherwise. And now, the updated app isn't opening at all. Wow.",negative
Do not force me to install the app to read on quora! I was reading through a post and it didn't allow me to continue further unless I installed the app.,negative
I am rewriting my review. This app used to be so good. Now I dont know why it takes ages for the pages/photos to load.,negative

"always tapping on notification s takes me to different articles, bad , and way of enforcing updates is also don't like",negative
"excelent job i'd like to have in this app a chat between 2 contacts or more,i mean for ask something extense or something private.",positive
Quora keeps changing my preferred language to Hindi forcibly just because I am an Indian. I am more comfortable in English. Auto change is starting to get really annoying because I cannot even change it back to English. It only changes back when it wants to. Idk what is up. Might as well just remove the app itself.,negative
"While I love Quora and sort of addicted to it, the app is quite buggy. It crashes a lot. Writings answers on app version is a nightmare. I prefer the web version of it.",negative
We do waste lots of time to answer then you delete that by giving some notifications even you blocked account after this we don't have good customer support or don't have contact us page good responding its just waste of time,negative
the app is good and all the keyboard related issues I've complained for earlier have been fixed and now what I'd suggest is to please implement dark/night mode or something of that sort cause reading in a dark room on a white screen is irritating for the eyes. thanks!,positive
"Pretty good. I can find answers to any questions I have, and read other things that are pretty much just for entertainment.",positive
"As far as I'm concerned it's a great app. No nonsense; you get what you see. If youre seeking to get some new insights, as well as share your various aspects of life, this is the app for you",positive
Great content but the app crashes every time I upvote an answer on my Moto G2. Cleared data and re-installed the app but to no avail.,negative
it is very helpful in getting knowledge on various topic...and also helpful in improving writing skill...but it does not have the feature to share things on other social media,positive
"Useful, knowledgefull, and informative. Probably the best app on play store for sharing ideas and knowledge through Q&A medium..!! it's better to join quora than to waste time on Instagram and Facebook.",positive
"i liked it but there was too many popup advertisents. i couldnt enjoy reading anything else. i uninstalled this app, hopefully it will stop showing ads.",negative
Scrolling through on mobile browser and got a pop up for I must download this application to continue or irreversably lose what I was reading. Obnoxious business tactic gets you a 1 star review.,negative

"Informative, Vast list of topics to discuss and understand. Mostly gets the job done in removing confusion.",positive

It's really good app for leaning new experience via articles. people give helpful answers...,positive
I try to refrain fron criticizing Quora as a whole but instead only the flaws in this app. This app has a grave sin that what you click is not always what you get. In 5/8 clicks it will misinterpret it and instead click somewhere else. This is the worst app i have that have this behaviour. I visit quora rarely because of this.,negative
I enjoy reading others experiences and answer to questions and I have been able to answer few questions too.,positive
"Good platform where you get to learn, read, imagine and write about lots of stuffs. Sometimes it'll kill your time like anything. But, if used wisely it's a very good companion",positive
worst experience. those topics which I have followed seldom appears in my feed while I am spammed by those unfollowed or sometimes even topics which annoyed me and I had mute earlier. UNINSTALLING,negative

"Atrociously difficult to navigate, forces you to choose at least 10 interests but difficult to find the ones you actually want to follow.",negative
your algorithm is like crappy and crazy! it never shoes at least s single question and answer from what i have subscribed. i need to see topics in my homepage from the subscribed topics.,negative
"I replaced Quora with instagram a couple of months ago because i realised that i have been unnoticeably spending too much time on social media, best decision I've ever made! now instead of wasting time being bored scrolling through meaningless posts and an overwhelming ammount of ads.. im getting my ass educated and im having fun reading all those brilliant answers! great community here on Quora! I'm not much of a reader myself, but i guess thats changing",positive
"While I love the concept of quora, and the answers/information on it, the UI is pretty terrible and constantly changing",negative

"I was just trying to view a post in the browser on my phone and a popup asking me to install the app shows up. No matter what I tried, the popup wouldn't go away. I am not going to use your app if you are going to force me into it. I would rather just stop browsing your website. I guess that's what you were looking for :)",negative
"There is a lot of good content. Was great at first. Now there are a lot of external ads, promoted conted, and ads disguised as answers. But still, worth it.",positive
"Incredibly insightful and useful. I love the way the feed is set up, there is always something new and interesting every time I look.",positive
Downloading only because I can't view the full thing from my mail cause these stupid annoying pop-ups just wouldn't let me.,negative

"i find it difficult to find profile info on the people asking me questions. When i select ""answer later"" to save a question, i find it difficult to actually find that question later. Mostly i like the app. Many, many people offer good information to me; i can offer good information to others.",neutral
Really poor content than few years ago. I really don't want to know what's the nicest thing someone has done for someone. Inspite of unfollowing everything related to that Quora finds a way to show the same stupid question.,negative

"I was forced to download this app. the pop-up blocked the entire screen to ""continue reading in quora app"" and forced me to either download the app or quit reading. Stop making bloatwares! 3rd time I was forced to download the app! 1-star all the way as long as I am forced to download the app. Regardless of how good it is (it's not much better than a ordinary browser), a bloatware is bloatware, people still complain about unnecessary pre-installed Google News and those are really well-designed",negative
Best alternative for Google.. sometimes it's saves time instead of googo which gives us lot of results,positive

"I use this app all the time. There is so much variety of questions/answers and the app works very smoothly. to the Quora admins: Andrew Clarks answer to ""A glitch puts you in charge of Quora for one hour. what do you do with it?"" was very good. points 3 to 5 would bring out some character in the app and make it even more likeable.",positive
it's been a month and no response to my query.. I'm unable to login with my account. It prompts to reset password and email has been sent. but no email received yet. No response of bug report..  worst service of Quora. Didn't expected.,negative
awesome app but having a problem with its update. it doesn't work without a update now and even with space and good internet I am unable to download the update.. don't know why.. if possible help,negative
"intrusive popups ""demanding"" download of this stupid app. they block the quora website in mobile view with no ability to close the popup.",negative
"The app seems fine, but I'm pretty irritated that Quora is forcing me to use the app, instead of allowing me to simply access the site with my phone browser. I can read 1/2 a page, when a non-closable pop up notice comes up.",negative

Amazing app to get credible answers for your questions. One also get different perspectives at one place.,positive
Well I keep using it and haven't found anything else much like it - most apps I have used don't pass the first test. it's pretty intuitive and doesn't feel invasive of privacy. And it provides individual stories on specific topics I have never found anywhere else.,positive
It was really wonderful experience being a quora member and the amount of knowledge one gets is unmatched. I have been using this app for the last three years and it really contributed its fair share in making me a better person.,positive
"I give 1-Star because there isn't anything lower. This app hijacked my phone and email account. I deleted this app and my email was returned to me. I reinstalled it just to leave a review. Then will be uninstalling ASAP. I wish I could come face to face with the person whom designed this app. There would be something worth a Pay-per-View happen. Have a nice evening folks, ROBERT",negative
wonderful time with quora. The only annoying thing is that it doesn't provide a dark theme or night mode.,positive
"Please give a night mode, apart from that it's a great app for content and knowledge sharing, but application can always evolve to be better.... since 3 years I am wishing for a dark mode or night mode...but all in vain, Quora doesn't listen to these reviews.",positive
"I only downloaded the app so I can leave a review. I just want to say screw you!! I dont want your damn app!! You should be happy I'm on your website. How dare you put your stupid little ""download app"" prompt over the content with no way to get rid of it. I will read the last couple questions I have in my email and then I will be deleting my account with you. You suck and now you won't have me as a reader at all.",negative

Shady and obnoxious. I downloaded the app just to write this review. Accidentally clicked something on their website and suddenly got a lot of emails. Tried to unsubscribe but there were like 20 different notification switches to turn off hidden in 5 different places. Tried to delete my account but you have to make a password in order to delete it. Eff you guys.,negative
Installing the app window kept showing Infront and locking me out while I was browsing Quora on Chrome like I always do! Don't force us to download the app,negative
"Love this app, great to learn about interesting topics and take time expanding my mind.",positive
It's irritating when you are forcing to download quora app and we can't view it on mobile browser.,negative

Such a pain really! I prefer reading online on browser rather than on app but no! Stupid suggestion keeps popping out and trying to force me on downloading the app also it say's it is free but keeps bothering and won't allow me to read online. I don't want to download your stupid app and I prefer to read it online ffs! How do I delete my account!!!,negative
"Well, the algorithm sucks. Most of the writers are overated. Still, a good alternative for insta & tinder though it works the same lol.",negative
nice to get other members opinions and there advice. the application is eady to use. with friendly interface.,positive
it's just like a Wikipedia. you search for answers to questions that no search engine can give you. It's Nice place to get answers to all sorts of questions,neutral
dont bring the pop-up to download app when I am in middle of reading the answer on browser. Moreover there is no 'cross' or back button to remove that pop-up. I have left so many good answers from home screen unread and incomppete,negative
"The very best, both in UI and content. It's like an encyclopedia that's updated 24x7 by millions of contributors every min of every day. I can't think of a better repository of knowledge and information, in any medium.",positive
"After the recent update, the app is totally screwed up. Really buggy interface makes reading answers a nightmare. I click on an answer and I'm redirected to some other answer. The links don't load properly! What's wrong Quora?! You screwed up a perfectly working app.",negative
"app is not working well..and more over i hate if a site forces us to download their app..even after downloading,they are not upto the mark..pity",negative
"remove the ""share within app"" feature. it duplicates content and makes like Facebook.",negative

Too much good for educational purposes And life time learnings from reading the experiences of people all over the globe üòä,positive
"i read answers and to save em for later , i simply bookmark them but to my knowledge i haven't been able to find my bookmarked answers. navigation is very hard nd not simple.",negative
Quora is the app we *should* be wasting our time on instead of blowing up gems or building virtual kingdoms. I learn something new with each visit.,positive
One of those apps that comsume a major share of my on mobile time apart from games. Sofar so good. Stil there is unlimited scope for some cool integrations. All the best. Happy Learning.,positive
"The app can be slow and unresponsive to taps at times, and it will needlessly ask you to ""Load More Stories"" after half an hour of browsing, which, when you've got a good string of interesting topics in the feed, is both annoying and slightly dangrous, as doing so will wipe them all out, and will get rid of your digest for the day.",negative
The stories and anecdotes make absorbing read.Some of them outstanding.I often use the narrator's experience to improve my life.,positive
"Forced to download. Have not and will not use an app I'm forced to download. Will soon unsubscribe from Quora emails as well if I'm still unable to view recommended content through my mail (which was the only reason I visited the site), thus cutting me off from Quora completely. Shame",negative
"I used to enjoy this platform and was an active contributor. suddenly I had to download the app in order to continue reading stories/questions. I don't know your reasons for doing this, but I have only downloaded the app to make this comment and now I will quit your service and delete the app.",negative
"Whatever the queries are ;whether it is related to exam, college, new place and many more ; there is always a best solution . Superb app for any kind of queries. Its literally help and provide better suggestion.",positive
"Quora's app is horrible. I love the Quora desktop site, there are many interesting questions and answers from users. Their mobile website sucks, it constantly shows an intrusive ad to install their app, if you close the ad, you lose the articles on the screen. In the app you can't dismiss a question or article you don't care about without a full screen page asking for your exact reasons for doing so. The app is also full of ads! You can't get rid of ads without a similar screen asking you why.",negative
"Very nice app, helped me a couple of times when I was looking for answers. There are topics for almost everything!!!",positive
Its my first review üòÑ Thanks for everything to the creater of this app and solving my questions about almost anything about IIT JEE and other. Simply a great app for students for there doubts,positive
Nice open platform to learn something new everyday and see what people think about things.,positive

"The most serious problem for me is that, quora doesn't allow you to use it online. Yuu just have to download the app to view your account. This is extremely irritating.",negative
"Trying to make people download app when browsing on web is a stupid move from Quora....Also if i leave an answer midway, i have no means to get back to that same answer.",negative
"I spend more time with Quora than with almost any app that does not apply specifically to my own affairs--although every day I find information and entertainment to which I relate. It's like having coffee with specialists in almost every topic that interests me, whether I expect it to or not. One should not expect to agree with everything one reads here, but I'm often astonished at the care Quorans take explaining complex subjects to people they don't even know, and their civility toward others.",positive
"Nice international forum with quick responses. Far too heavily tilted to ultra, hyperfanatical liberalism. If you're center of the aisle or leaning conservative, it's an unbelievably skewed sight (not in the favor of fairness, equality, debate, or open ideas).",negative
quora helps In learning from the experiences and knowledge from the other peoples .that is really amazing.it will be better if we could get the meaning of every difficult word just by clicking on them or it should give the facility to copy the word for searching it's meaning,positive
experience! it is one of the best gift to mankind. things they need to ponder on: 1. adv. they have a lot of advts. 2. BNBR policy. 3. they should pay to the writer.,positive
"A big design failure, bloated with lots of ads and news articles. Why there's a big X (close button) at the bottom, even though Android provides native back button? Very very cluttered app with things going completely haywire in this app. App needs total revitalization.",negative
I think the app is amazing honestly I think the app is part of my heart and my life if I lose it I will be suffering again!üíû,positive
"I don't want to use the app, but whenever I have any tab open on chrome on my phone, it keeps on giving me an unclosable popup telling me to download the app, I DON'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD YOUR BLOODY APP.",negative
"quora is wonderful..but the app isnt what the website is,infact its not even close...the app is mostly know as a text based tool it should load quickly just like whatsapp..a lite text friendly app i feel is required.i unistalled quora i didnt wanted to but had to as it wasnt working well but the website is great,hence i restrict myself to web based quora only.",positive
"The app gets stuck opening pages even when my internet connection is working fine. It takes ages to open up some links, and god forbid if you have to check someone's profile pic, it will just keep on loading.",negative
"This is ridiculous. I enjoy reading the occasional article on Quora and all of a sudden it's forcing me to use the App. My phone is chosen for battery life, not storage space, and I have no desire to use an app when the mobile site works just fine. I don't have a computer, just my phone, and unlike facebook the Quora site has no way to opt out of the app. I installed it, hated it, and now I'm uninstalling and deleting my profile as soon as I'm done with this review.",negative
diverse and addictive stories. people just being honest. amazing tales of their lives. some funny and some tragic.,positive
"It is really good very informative, a lot good reading materials especially business side and their success. but lately i am seing a lot of naughty sex experience stories even with their own cousins and siblings or in laws or aunts or step father which i find it not appropriate ti your kind of medium.",positive
Simple and awesome. But in the answer and then request section there is no option to UNDO once I press pass even by mistake. Please do it. I have missed many questions like this.,negative

Quora has been very useful and informative. Questions/topics have good quality responses. I definitely find it very useful...,positive
"Quora is good but the app is worst. The app is not responding since the last 2 updates. I have tried too many times and I am fed up with the app. It is not only in my case, even my freiends are also facing the same problem",negative
"I've been on Quota a few years and have learned, benifeted from the insights shown and sometimes even been encouraged. This year I hope to contribute more.",positive
This is app is for keep and better than any other social media platforms. Less toxic and you got to learn everything from any topic of your interest. I allocate most of time here during spare time and I woudn't say my time is wasted 'coz I'm learning something new every now and then.,positive
"signed up for your service but it literally won't let me read content online, cuts me off in the middle of stories to make me download the app. the app is garbage with too many ads and push notifications. I'll be unsubscribing",negative

"Super slow. And won't allow to read on browser, forcing every time to install this app, the slowest app on Playstore.",negative
Useless app. Do not download. Overloads phone. Makes it slow. Very buggy. And screw you for trying to force me to download your app.,negative
This is simple question answer app... Theme is not so user friendly... Too many parameters upvote follower for every Q n A.... Need some tutorial video... Provide some good platform for creator n viewer for promoting his contents...,negative
I used to like reading the questions people asked and the answers they got. I downloaded the app again recently and one of the first forums I saw were extremely pornographic...the sort of things people wrote in to Hustler magazine. There's a place for that but it didn't expect to see it on Quora. I uninstalled the app.,negative
"it is a very good app for learning. Here people can learn while just passing their time.  anyone can clear  their doubts here. its anyone can learn,can ask and can enjoy  Thank you",positive

"Amazing app, but there is no option of reading my Daily Quora Digest for any particular day, if by mistake I refresh my quora feed. Then ,the option to load Quora Digest disappears. That's why I reduced one star from rating.",negative
"Awesome app, you can get knowledge of everything, also a good platform for the beginner writers to start or get reviews on their writing skills. Updates are more frequent without it we are not able to open the app.",positive
"There is no difference between reading Quora online and reading it on the app, save that the app takes up far too much space. Unfortunately Quora has now decided to push the issue and is presenting an unskippable popup on their site if you try to read it on a phone browser.",negative
"I did not want to install yet another app but the mobile site doesn't want to offer another choice with its annoying, un-closable pop-ups telling you to get the app. Uninstalling it as soon as I finish this review.",negative
awesome app. I was able to recover my account after my phone was stolen and I was locked out of all my accounts.,positive
I find it very useful and informative to the source as well as consumers. Descent interface. Good job..,positive
pleeeease add dark/nigh mode for ease of eye(and battry) this app is mostly about text...about reading for long time; how developers could misconsider this simple option?! look at wikipedia app and learn! its very good example,positive

"I don't want the app. I hate the overlay on the website and I'm writing a review to tell you that I don't want the app so stop pushing it on me. I resent being forced to download the app in order to use quora on mobile. I don't need an app for everything - and quite frankly, I'm more likely to stop using the site entirely out of sheer spite than giving in. I don't mind being reminded that the app exists but there is no way to exit the overlay on the website rendering it unusable and pointless.",negative
"Quora it's a very beautiful collection of knowledge. Best app but they want to update about they app and all languages. And if we give our name is full capital letters,they will block us. For ex:APPLE is wrong, so we have to type Apple.",positive
Quora is too useful as it involves updation around the world. people too share their experiences from someone can learn.,positive
A very good platform for enhancing one's knowledge & obviously better than other social media apps.,positive
3 star for annoying ads and random questions in the feed. There is no way to filter them,negative
Awful moderation. I got blocked many times just because I used my nickname instead of real name. Some of my answers to peoples questions were blocked even though I followed All the rules.,negative
Nice app. Helps me with my studies too. But 4 star since the app makes me download it without a chance to skip.Please fix that.,positive
"I love this app!!! Its very educational. One thing that was a little strange is their real name policy, but its not anything major.",positive
"useless now. if you scroll their site too long, they'll force you to login, and even if you do login, they'll then ask you to install this application. if you don't do as said, you won't be able to read anything.",negative
It is a great app to compare computer programmer options. Foreign opinions of their country and how they see North America culture.,positive
phenomenal... brings out the creative side in me... An enjoyable platform that celebrates the love for learning!...,positive
The user interface is pretty bad and although the whole idea/theme of the app is really good it has many flaws!,negative

the app lags a lot and seriously it's annoying that we can't read full articles on web but have to download a good for nothing app like this...,negative
Every update makes some new issues in app. Now app is loading first post only and not loading remaining one.,negative
In the latest version there is no option to scroll down. All I can see is one answer and one advertisement. Please fix this quickly.,negative
"Used to be great. Now there's no way to get a feed with more than one question. Also, no in app help or seemingly way to fix it.",negative

"Prefer the website, but it sticks a pop-up you can't get rid of on the page. The is no need for this to exist",negative
App works great 99% of the time but right now i have an issue of Quora only loading one question when i open the app.,neutral
"There's something wrong with the current update, can't scroll down and only one answer and one advertisement is seen. Also, can't open it in phone browser for long as it quickly opens a pop-up window asking to download the app. Please fix this.",negative
"New Update is terrible - I uninstalled Quora because, unlike before, you can't scroll through many questions nor can you see all the responses to the questions. This used to be my go to App, but not anymore. I hope Quora changes it format fast.",negative
"i am having a lot of trouble populating stories on my feed page, the feed will have only one story and i cant scroll neither can i update any stories. this ia with latest update.",negative
The app is very slow even in fast network and to display a single image it takes more than a minute It's way better in browser than in app I wrote the review because the image was not loading even after going back to the app after a minute its still loading.,negative
very interesting app for eager people... who always want to know everything. my interest is in mythology nd i get best knowledge about that in this app.also it contains many fact about science nd technology... nd it is very easy to use üëç,positive

Good app. Very helpful. Frequent loading issues and unavailability of the app is frustrating. Frequent downtime,positive
Doesn't let me log in.... Can't use on web browser as it keeps redirecting to app... and app doesn't log in.,negative
Amazing app. It is very addictive if you love to read random things. It is a world of random knowledge. Thanks for making this app.,positive
Platform and the idea behind is good. Ask and you ll get answers. However moderation is not neutral. There are plenty harassment about Turks and Turkey and they do allow. When you ask alike or just answer proper they limit access or remove your content. The idea behind it and the platform is good anyways. It should be neutral.,negative
"The application gets annoying with every update particularly with this recent update it has turned awfull. There is only single answer in the feed,no option to scroll down, comments not getting loaded. All these things are robbing the great experience which otherwise quora provides. Please fix this immediately.",negative
There is a black screen on home page of my quora app. even after update the problem is not solved. need help.,negative
"i am forced to give a one star rating. I was happily reading Quora in my web browser. as i proceed to another topic, it made me to install this app bu force by making a pop up which would never disappear. Dear quora team I like to read quora content as i stroll through the Google as per my need, please do not make your need as my only option.",neutral
"Great app. Good quality, organized, clean and with great community. Suggest everyone to download.",positive
Compelling us to download your app is very rude of you QUORA. You should not forget that app is not the platform which have given you so much popularity. P.S.-Going to uninstall after reading a post.,negative
This is the perfect platform to share our thoughts and also the best place to learn something new. Most of the questions are answered which we sometimes don't even find in Google.I'm using quora for the last one year and its an amazing experience with Quora and called to be a Quorain. Thanks Quora!,positive
"the only reason this app gets a 1 star review is because they bully you into downloading the app when browsing through their website. I have had this app before and while it is good, it tends to spam you with digest notifications. I needed to delete it for space on my phone. the site asks you 5 times if you want the app because it's better, but afterwards it shows you a passive aggressive pop up saying to download the app that you can't click away.",negative
it is a awesome app and as it say it actually helped me understanding the world much better..... try it for sure you will not regret,positive
Great app. Nice user interface. App seems to take too much time to load even in 4G networks. I would suggest to develop offline answering feature.,positive
"After updating the app all i can see is one question and one ad. Even after removing the ad and opting for, irrelevant ad shown, same thing is coming again. The question and the ad is repeating even after reopening the app multiple times.",negative
Again one star forced by you making me add the app. I am perfectly happy searching the website on my smart phone without making it an app. The app was deleted and I'm also unsubscribing to your email since I can't read any of it without this app I refuse to get because the website was good enough.,negative
I love this app. I've learned so much from others on various topics. I also love reading other people's perspectives on a wide range of topics.,positive
Surely it's a great application as well as a grest platforms. Thanks Developers.,positive
"The app is ok but ads will start to pop up like crazy everywhere & every time you click something almost had to factory reset the phone until I found out ot was this app. I don't mind ""in app"" ads but common really? Every touch in the screen even in other apps?",negative
"i dont want the app, its slow and gives nothing more than the mobile site. the stupid thing is that after scrolling a bit on the mobile site youre FORCED to download the app otherwise you cant do anything anymore... whoever thought that's a good idea is beyond me. dont force your readers to download an app they dont want to. dont force your readers to download an app BY PREVENTING THEM FROM USING YOUR PRODUCT. provide some kind of value to make people WANT the app, not shove it down their throats",negative
Best and interesting way to get knowledge and keep yourself updated with everything...,positive
"I love quora for the answers. However, I find it difficult or almost impossible to find answers I bookmarked. Same goes with answers I upvoted. Otherwise it's been a pleasurable experience.",positive

I was kinda forced to download this application. I never had the intention of downloading this application. As another user has mentioned that a pop up would appear while strolling through the web browser that I would be browsing and never disappear. This was quite annoying.,negative

"I really like quora! There are so many topics covered and it's interesting to read so many different points of view on each. It's a great place to share your experiences, with the added advantage of going ""anonymous"" if you have something very personal to share, or are afraid of being judged harshly by others, but still want feedback on your experience.",positive
The dev needs to include a change list when they provide updates. I will not update any app without one.,neutral

"a convenient app, but an optional night mode/dark theme needs to be provided as well",neutral
"it used to be very good now its the worst thing ever. wont load more than one answer , will constantly hang , will tell you again and again fill up the info , will suggest you useless things . worst of all is censorship. it seems quora , which used to be an open platform , is like most other SOCIAL media platforms is now under the control of left.",negative
"Gets pretty addictive sometimes! Would like to highlight certain improvement points - Answer cards on android app can't be closed by swiping while the same was possible on iOS - Discovery of questions that I would like to see and answer is not very great, I hardly get questions in my feed that I woild be encouraged to answer",negative
"It provides a good platform to share ideas as well as asking doubts you have openly, those who answer are also qualified or of the same field, you have the query for. So you can get good answers.

"its an amazing app to improve your knowledge base & get your queries answered by expert's,the user interface can be improved with more emphasis on posting questions",positive
"Although I appreciate what Quora are doing to create one of the wonderful platforms for writers and readers alike, the amount of bias in terms of forcing ads not related to my interests and the stupidity of the app not to give me an option to tell the app I've read the exact certain answers and please never show this same answer in my home again. You know what I mean, don't you? When closing an answer there're only two options: Downwote/Report. Really? Why not ""I've seen it, don't feed again""?",negative
Always get hooked and spend far more time on it than anticipated... Just read this one answer. Ye right üòâ amazing!,positive

Great job guys..cool app but need to work for the authenticity of the material(facts ) provided by the users..and keep updating the app..,positive
I joined the site because I got some very informed answers on Quora to questions I looked up using the search engine. I found that whenever I searched for answers that Quora was usually on the first page. I decided to diwnload the app and have never looked back.,positive
One of the the best Apps to get your doubts solved by experienced personnel with a profound and logical answers. simply love it!,positive
i actually love quora for the most part. But the way they treat prolific people as well as those on the partner program is appalling.,negative
"I love this app but there are a couple of things I wish they'd change/fix. When you click on a link that goes to an external site, it can't be opened in the browser. It always opens in the Quora app. This isn't always a problem but if/when you want to zoom in on an image that's on an external site, you can't, period. The app does allow you to zoom in on images from the Quora site but not images from external sites. Also, there is no way to ""long tap"" a link to have it open in the browser.",negative

great app for gaining knowledge and clearing doubts about career and life. A must have app for every student.,positive

"a fabulous app for a great idea, though i want to suggest a little improvement please add a separate tab for bookmarked answers.",positive
"You forced me to download this app, why you can't let me use the website. Everytime i am at the last section of reading any post you put a pop up which can't be closed or hide. Shame on those companies who do such kinf of practices.",negative
I have recently started using this app. This app is an excellent source of information over wide range of topics. Especially for students it is an useful guide for exam preparation and all other issues related with exam.,positive
it very good app for who always curious to know interisting and new things..You can also asked question whatever you want to know..such a impressive app.i like it so much..thank u Quora.,positive
Everything is absolutely fine but the only problem is some people are using Quora as a sex story telling platform. I request you to block those fake Accounts or delete those answers.,negative
it is the best platform I know of to ask a question and get an intelligent answer. answers with multiple points of view.,positive

Disappointed. website is always better. The app does not show pics related to the answers,negative
"ultimately the best choice. I'm a book worm so I like hearing and comparing with critics on what different minds have to share on a specific topic. Quora on the other hand, has gladly put up a solid palate for a straight forward communicative circle where all get to share what they think about from moments to moments.",positive
"has access to your search history. no thanks. i liked quora until i realized that they force you to opt out of access to your search history. anyone else catch this? if its clearly and plainly stated, ill bump up my rating to 3 stars.",negative
there is no way to edit your topics after selwcting them in the app tho on the desktop site it is possible please make the UI more appealing,neutral
some questions are totally idiotic. But also contains some good and informative replies. overall it can be rated as good.,positive
"The app, and Quora as a whole, continues to disappoint me time and time again. Here's some examples: forcing you to use the app when you just want to quickly view a Quora page from a Google search, barring you from using it if you don't have the latest version (making it hard to avoid bad updates), the strange high battery usage when idle, and how much Quora has become obsessed with publicity and selling out. There's way more I want to add, but Google added a character limit. Oh well.",negative
"Galaxy S7: Would be great if we could edit/choose credentials WHILE writing an answer.  Right now, the app requires you to post your answer, then go back and edit the credential after it has been posted. I sometimes wonder if people are being notified of my answer with the ""wrong"" credential, which might make them less likely to view it.  By contrast, when using the website, you can pick your credential while writing your answer.  Also, there are times when I get push notifs on my phone, but when I tap them, the app just loads a blank screen.  Only happens when I enter the app via notifications -- if I close out and then tap the app icon, the app opens as normal, but then I have to manually find my way to whatever item the notification was trying to show me.",neutral
"Great! since the app asked me if I speak French, I am stuck with 1/100th of the content and no possibility to switch to English!",negative
"Being forced to install app while I should be able to access the site on the browser.. Every time I start reading an article, a msg pops up forcing me to install app. Not a pleasant experience.",negative

downloaded the app just to leave a review. hate that you are FORCING people to doenload your crummy apo when it was so much bettet to use on chrome. going to delete the app and find something else yo read my stuff on. quora ruined it with forcing people onto that cruddy app.,negative

"In this busy world, readers are declining. At least we can have small reading sessions daily regarding our field of interest. Quora, performs best for the same. Must have app.",neutral
Forced to download app! Full screen pop ups which wont close asking me to download app when browsing normally..,negative
we want the web not to the application to be shoveled down our throats by intrusive notification that we should download this application. These are the things that make me abandon platforms all together. Better to pay for the platform than have such a horrible experience!,negative
I love this app it answers all my questions.Helps me with answers for my future job(Therapy).Especially good at answering questions with Mental health.,positive
"Generally it's a quite good app and the service itself is also helpful. However, there is a small negative moment, namely some questions appear to be written by robots with aim to involve users in discussion. But Im not sure that this is the case.",neutral
Best... seriously good use of social media.. really knowledgeable and helpful in all aspects.. go for it!!!,positive
why are you pushing to add hindi as additional language in my profile. This is inapropriate behaviour from your team. uninstalling your app right away.,negative
"Quora is a dynamic, tossed salad of questions, opinions, antidotes, and experiances. Texts longer than twitter while informative, funny, or causing your eyeballs to squint, well up or pop wide.... And the pro-peeps are pretty cool in sharing. :-)",positive
forcing to install app whenever trying to surf from browser. Its very iritating. Also the standard of quora has gone down.,negative
"Not sure why everyone is loving this app. It doesn't work. Time after time I got a notification that I needed to confirm my email, and time after time it was a broken link. I couldn't do a damn thing in this app. Will not try again.",negative
I love Quora and have learned about a variety of subjects. I not only read and learn but also ask questions I need good and reliable answers for. lt is like going to School again but you don't have set hours or homework. l highly recommend. Deborah,positive
"Apt was OK. Quora staff is poor, and I'm being polite. Many participants' questions are inane, but some are quite good as are the answers. Quora can be beneficial at times, but I don't have the time.",positive
12/1/2018 - first review A full page add popped up. I quite enjoy quora and the people that use it but come on. This is 2018. An embedded add in your app? quit it.,negative
"I don't want this stupid app. But when I try to use Quora through the browser on my phone an ad saying ""It's better in the app"" pops up constantly and tries to get me to install it. There's no way to get rid of the popup. I REFUSE to be coerced into using their idiotic app and am considering abandoning Quora altogether. Those who feel like I do please join me in bad-mouthing Quora in as many places as possible and making trouble for them in any way we can!!!",negative
"I give 5 stars because I love quora, but not this app, it won't run when the internet is slow (but other app in the same smartphone run perfectly). Many times I had to read quora from the browser, not from the app, it's a kind of funny.",positive

I loved it. It is actually the Ocean of knowledge and information. You can collect information and data through this and also provide to others through your knowledge by answering the asked questions or by creating your own question. The previous version of app was not good and was not supporting to my mobile but this version is running smoothly and I am really enjoying this Social Media platform. If you are hungry of knowledge and information you may use this App.,positive
I love this app. It gives me so much confidence for my board exams.There are really many great people. We can share our experience with others.,positive
Annoying quora mobile site sent me here and made me give you a star... so here i am giving you a star. And what is rhe reason we can't use the mobile site for more than one article? Because mobile browsers have pop up blockers and block your annoying ads? hah,negative
"This app was wonderful up until a couple of days ago. now it doesn't matter where I go, my feed, daily digest, or a specific topic. The app will only add 2 or 3 questions/stories & then it wont load any more. Even when I try to reload the app, or clear cache/ data. I even restarted my phone just to make sure. Other apps works just fine. Only with this one does it only load 2 or 3 stories & just stops, whether im using data or wifi. It is quite annoying.",negative
It's awesome app for specially those who preparing for competitive exams. There are lots of experience share by students who clear those exams,positive

"Such desperate losers you guys are! What an annoying experience you guys bring to the web user. Don't play your cheap tricks to increase the downloads. Why don't you guys just stop support of web version in phone instead of throwing annoying pop ups and forcing users to install the app to read an article. The pop up cannot even be closed.

"Miles ahead of any other Q&A site or app, in terms of quality content and proper moderation. Quora has a feed, and you can go there to learn, which is truly unique among social media sites. Maybe the best Q&A app, but it's really let itself go, sadly. Almost half of the content seems promoted or auto-generated. Whatever it takes to stay afloat, I guess.",positive

Why am I forced to use this app? I want to use safari with multiple tabs open but it keeps forcing me to use this stupid thing! It's CLEARLY a website you need multiple tabs for!!,negative
Got me to relax a bit on issues I was tense with like in the case of the woman in an abusive relationship who was travelling with her abusive spouse. I found her to be very brave.

Amazing app to share your knowledge and get back answers to your unsolved queries. One also gets a feeling of self-satisfaction for getting appreciation and upvotes for their answers.,positive
"When you view the website on a mobile device, half way through the answer you're reading, pops up a notice you can't dismiss telling you that you must download this app. Even if you download the app, you never can find the answer you were just reading, leaving you with disappointment, never to find out how the story ended.",negative

This app deserves 5 star rating. But while using this app my mobile buttons (specially back and home button) do not respond. I use Lenovo K8 note.,negative
Quora is really a huge and interactive knowledge bank. I feel absolutely obliged to this continuously expanding store of information.,positive
The images in the answers do not load sometimes inspite of a working internet connection. Refreshing the answer twice or thrice gets the images,negative
"Versatile, complex yet easy. A well deserved 5 * rating. If only there weren't so many stupid people in the world using this app. üòï",negative
My only problem with this app is the small size of the main body text font. Could you perhaps add an option to change the size? Not all of us have excellent eyesight.,negative
"Reviewing the app, not the site (which is fantastic by the way.) I don't how this app can lag on a phone with 6 gigs of RAM, SD 636 and no background tasks, but it does exactly that while writing answers or browsing for a longer time. Also wish there was a way to share answers/articles to pocket.",negative
"It's a great app, i love using it to learn new things, read about people's experiences and their advice to others. Having a night mode would be amazing, since reading with so much light can hurt your eyes. And i wpuld love if you could see ALL your voting history, even your downvotes",positive
"What's the point of having an app, when anyone can do same stuff in browser. It's just we are forced to log in and use app. Well done big corporate quora üëè üëè",neutral

An extremely useful app where we get answers to many queries and also get opinion of different people.,positive
This help me to get a good idea and a good experience... And it also help me to increase of vocabulary.... This so helpful for me...,positive
"this app is a nuisance. you start reading interesting articles in your emails and 'download the free app' message comes up. there's no way to get rid of it, even if you already have downloaded the app previously. it spoils the experience. I'm cancelling my subscription.",negative
keeps crashing all the time on top of it the worst thing about accessing this on mobile is that they dont let you browse on your mobile browser unless you set it to desktop view,negative
"I feel I have learned things here and been inspired by the folks. So many varied topics , and slants on them. Thank you all..",positive
Please update with a dark theme!! An option to reverse the colours for night time reading and I'll give 5 stars!,positive

"this app sucks. it forces you to download the app, when you're pretty much comfortable using the browser and even after downloading it still tell you to download. i used to love quora back in the day. spending most of my time here than anywhere else. Now i can't spend five minutes on this thing. It has become pathetic.",negative
"The problem was that I was happily searching questions in quora through google but then the ad download the free app came. And it won't go. No cancel button, no clicking outside works. So it basically forced me to download the app. So screw you.",negative

"its a very useful knowledgeable app... u can get any information ,views ,idea or suggestion by experts in that particular field..",positive
"Awesome app. It connects us with many higher level teachers,friends. This app is too good for science lovers from my point of view",positive
Freezes seconds after loading. Can't tap answer or pass on any questions. Can switch between tabs like profile and notifications.,negative
this is the only app thay helps me connect with the people and the thoughts they have regarding any field which i find interesting,positive
You can ask anything and everything even if it is a stupid or sometimes vile. The best part is there is always someone who answers the questions intelligently.,positive
This app is interesting and us full for students and we got here to learn new things everyday by people experiences and their advices.We get her to learn anything we want.And the best part of this app is that this is available in many languages.,positive
since I was a teenager in high school all right about World War II all the time and high school most of my time was taken by reading historical World War II I didn't get a lot of good grades but I learned a lot my history books from World War II!!!! from high school at the library!!,positive
"I enjoy the personal experiences and very much enjoy the intelligence on all subjects, especially the ones from professionals on theories! Quora is always interesting and informative!",positive
"Eats far too much battery power on Android 9. About 8% of total use on my phone. The only higher user is a graphics-intensive fast moving game, if that's a good yardstick. Also doesn't have the same shortcuts for, for instance, em-dash (two hyphens) or horizontal lines (four underscores+newline) found on the web version.",negative
"Was forced to download the app. I was reading one single article on the site and the screen locked me out, saying I needed to download the app to continue reading. There was no way to get rid of the pop up to continue reading the rest of the page. I downloaded the app, and was unable to find the article again on either the browser I was using or the app itself, since I clicked on it through random feed. Poor design decision to get people to download the app.",negative
"Not very useful. Required ""real"" name policy is stupid considering some of the things I've seen on this app. Seems to me there are plenty of topics and answers that I find inappropriate or offensive that are okay by Quora as long as you make yourself known. And yet I would rather be anonymous and write topics and answers that are at least not as offensive as I've seen. Complete rubbish. Deleting and getting back to real life.",negative
"amazing. it is a good way to learn new things. It is a tiny appüòâ, but huge like ocean... ocean of the knowledge.üòç. I really appreciate the feature of spaces I join so many spaces that is very helpful to gain more knowledge about my favorite topics and the topics I have to work in my daily work, at office, at home. if you want to learn more you should definitely join Qouraüòâüòé‚úå",positive

No bloody option to keep reading, just "" either install the app or exit"". I'm sure the app is great but now I won't use it on principle.",negative
"Describing this app would be like describing how benevolent sun is to the us tellurians. Unequivocally AWESOME. Nothing falls near in comparison to usefulness of this app. And, YES...!!! I loved it. ‚ù§",positive
"dear dev, please add the night mode. it will be so much helpful for user, especially those who use quora at night or those who open the app for some hours.. that's all I want to have in future update, overall it's a great app and helpful for learning a new stuff.",positive
"Overall, a good base for opinions on issues. Some questions seem trivial, and the format could be improved by allowing back-and-forth opinions and follow-up questions.",neutral
Great app...Please add a night mode to help reading in the dark..,positive
Interface could be improved. Drastic changes is needed in interface.,neutral
"I love this app! I learn a lot, and most of the answers (in my topics of interest) are very entertaining and touching. One of my only qualms is that editing or even just writing a comment can be annoying in the app because it autocorrect quickly and wrongly..other than that, it's great!",positive
"Quora views are well-balanced. There is sincerity in the answers given so far. However, Quora plunges into all areas which may become difficult for the followers to stick to their area. Using icons and graphics to choose one's area of interest can be of great utility.",positive
I find it extremely knowledgeable in the categories that fit me. The respect and support from people all over is incredible and feels safe. I recommend it to anyone who needs answers or different views and understanding that you are not the only one out there needing some insight,positive
It is very useful tool to get your answer. I have major feedback is that there is interesting question coming and while reading if you lost your network you can't get your reading question or there isnt any history of questions which you went through.,positive
App doesn't even load. Just lags a bit then shows a black screen.,negative
"Pls allow user to read of chrome app instead of force pushing the app , the app itself does not make reading any morr enjoyable. You are killing your readers.",negative
"Very bad of Quora....we people just to help each other write answers by sending a lot of time for free and you people just to earn money , force everyone to download ur app. Very pathetic and cheap of u. I know you want to earn but this way , this money will never satisy ur need. Mind it. Soon ur startup will fail and this website will close down.",negative
"dirty tactic by quora for web users,once in a while they will simply make the website unusable for web browsers by showing the ad for downloading the app.No option to close the ad except to refresh again,stop using the site for 2 days and it's restored to normal. forcing to download app is nasty way.",negative
"This is not an app for all truths. If you're a leftist you'll love it but if you happen to be a right leaning conservative you should expect your posts to be routinely removed under the false pretense of ""not being nice"".",negative
Poorly optimized for image loading. why do posts contained full sized image? you should show scaled down version of image until explicitly clicked/browsed for full image.,negative
"This app is a load of BS. Whenever I get an email from Quora and decide to read it, I cant read past a certain point without getting a popup for this app that cannot be closed. Hitting back on my phone takes me to my inbox, and even if I am fast and skip ahead to where I was reading before, I still get the popup (basically once you scroll so far down it doesn't let you read any further because of the popup). I'm not going to keep an app on my phone that I don't want and am forced to use. -5 star",negative
"As others report I was forced by a popup to download the app in order to read a thread. Would like to browse through and read without ""signing up"". Have uninstalled",negative
"Great app, although not quite personalised enough with the types of questions in your digest or feed.",positive
"endless enjoyment reading questions and writing answers. generally, much more educated/sophisticated users, than say Facebook, providing intelligent input for discussion. are all discussions intellectually sophisticated? of course, they are not, but even some those are often fun to follow and join in.",positive
this is an awesome place to learn many different things and points of you. Mark Twain would have loved it.,positive
"Quora is probably one of my most treasured apps! I have learned soooooo much! I recommend Quora to any one regardless of the subject matter! I cannot Express the gratitude... it is deep, vast, and I don't know how I've managed over the years without it! Thank you all who contribute very, very much!!! My life is changing. It is truly amazing!!",positive
there is no reason to force download of the app when i was peacefully browsing the webpage... this app sucks. stop forcing us to download..,negative
This app is riddled with touch issues. It never goes to the answer or question I touched on. It always goes to the item below it. There's so much lag when loading answers and comments even on high speed wifi. And you guys don't allow us to use the mobile version of the site. This app is destroying my ability to browse quora. Please fix it.,negative
I love quora app. It enables us to help wide range of people all over the world and increase our knowledge too.i love writing and reading on quora.,positive
earlier i use to read Quora . but it forced me to install app which i won't do. why should I install any app without any genuine reason. earlier relevant notification caused me to read Quora...... but i will stop notification also.... what's use if I can't read it completely. yet I am loyal enough to inform you. thanks quora.... and good bye for ever.,negative
I don't like being forced to download the app. I too was reading a single article online after you sent me emails with links to different information. so basically you want access to Snoop on my phone. That's completely dishonest and it's very disappointing to have had this kind of experience right off the bat.,negative
not very intutive to show the daily feed about the selected topics. i have slected many topics or spaces but the app shows me daily uodat for only a few od them.,negative
I am only giving this rating based on the fact that they literally force you to download the app. I love going to their website and reading the articles. UNTIL they use a pop up that cannot be closed and covers the ENTIRE SCREEN! I understand that they want you to down load the app. Great! but they shoukd also realize that not everyone wants to do that.,negative
I love this app... very informative but with just one caveat. UX n UI are very unintuitive. I have no idea why searching through answers to a question can sometimes look awful. Like why are ads sharing the same visual templates as answers? I get the idea that it makes the ads seemingly non-intrusive but there are better ways. Ask Reddit! Try n copy what Reddit did with their mobile app or even Boost for Reddit. I'm just saying it can be improved.,negative
"I simply love this app. it addresses a lot of life's issues, and I greatly appreciate the civility and honesty (I believe so), on quora. I really do find it therapeutic and uplifting. Nice one.",positive
"I feel forced, I liked to read quora in my gmail inbox but now every time I try, it let's me for a few seconds then it pops up saying download the quora app. since no other button worked and I couldn't continue reading the article I finally gave in but feel like I was forced into it. maybe it will stop now I've downloaded it.",negative
Questions and answers on the widest variety of subjects! Informative and entertaining.,positive
I am appalled that there is no option to change the size of font. letters appear very small and comments are even smaller. it's getting really difficult to read and I have been getting headaches because of this. Kindly include an option to change the word size.,negative
"My experience is good with 'Quora' it's a best app. But I want to share one thing with Quora, here most of the people are sharing about 'Bollywood rumors' non-related thing's which is not good at all. I want that now Quora need to be strict.",neutral
"I don't understand why users are forced to download the app. Whenever I want to read an article, I open it in browser and it locks me out and that stupid pop-up doesnt go away. App isn't that user friendly. It's really super irritatingüò†üò†üò†",negative
[UPDATE] - after years of use i'm finally uninstalling. They've become no better than Yahoo Answers of old. People answer questions for views even if they are distinctly not qualified or the requested person. It's sad to see Quora devolve to this. Real answers that are unparalleled with the depth of their content,negative
my experience with Quora has been great I spend slot of time on Quora probably more then I should but the answers are interesting and make me ü§î want to read more.,positive
"its definitely an app for people who want to learn more, however i was almost forced into installing this app though I was comfortable using the website version.",positive
I don't like the app the website is much better reading experience. only to include your downloads and upgrades every time this irritating pop ups happen,negative
"i am not able to open the quora app...not even able to read it in chrome...in chrome after some time, one popup is coming as open in quora app...giving 1 rating as there is no zero...i tried to unonstall and install the app..but it didnot work..please help me out of this..",negative
It has been a good experience... through this app we can check or compare the things even if you have some confusion... you can clear via this..‚úåÔ∏è,positive
I cannot switch user. This is a basic functionality that this app doesn't have. Many other apps provides functionality to swich between accounts seamlessly in case more than one person is using same device.,negative
Great app and site. Usually find answers here for what I'm looking for and sometimes answer stuff too. very clean app.,positive
"i love this, I love reading all the articles and it's all so interesting and seeing people's views and opinions on things... I got irritated having being asked to download the app, but eventually did... I don't mind, just getting to things quicker... but I'm enjoying it!",positive
"Used to be four stars (good, but with issues), but now it's barely worthy of one. Newsflash: Everyone hates being forced to download an app while in the middle of reading an answer. It's irritating, and it makes me want to quit the platform altogether.",negative
The app- and site- is terrible! You're required to share your full name with anyone who sees your profile. Otherwise you get blocked! It's absolutely absurd. No concerns for safety for those of us trying to avoid stalkers or other potential dangers. Disappointed!,negative
"I love it, it broadens my knowledge in diverse topics.Improves writing skills , vocabulary in a very interesting way.",positive
"I really liked using the app till a few weeks ago. Since then, everytime I try to write an answer or ask a question, the app crashes and even after reopening, it still lags a lot. Really disappointed with the app.",negative
thats a very good platform where we can gain more knowledge as well as we can give some ü§ó i love this application there r lots of q&a which helps me to understand properly without any doubt at all . i love to use this app while am seaching something about more coz in this app there r many exports answers which r really help me to figure out any problem very easily and also in short tim e ....so i would like to recommend others who actually wonna gain some knowledge about anything but geniune .,positive
"well its a good platform. we all know that, but it still needs improvement. also, sometimes it a bit laggy.",neutral
"Previous version was good, had the option of sharing the answer outside quora through links. Now we can't share it with anyone. This update sucks.",negative
There is a bug in the app after recent updates can't see comments can't get all the stories u need keep on tapping more stories options please fix it asap,negative
"It's a cool place to talk about stuff. Can be weird to get used to when you have ads, since they appear to be an included part of the current content. Changing the ads to a different font and some other changes would make that easier.",positive
The service is great but for the last few days it refuses to load more than 2-3 stories. looks like others are also having this problem. Edit: The problem is now resolved.,negative
I've enjoyed the experience of being sble to answer questions from others and also reading Q and A's from others.,positive
Forced to download the app because of an annoying pop up which keeps showing on my browser. Can never finish an article,negative
"The website is far better than the app, but the sad part is the developer wants to promote the app, so leaves a stupid pop up on the website to use the app. The app has 2 problems; 1) The links don't open on my phone and the browser crashes as I open links from quora app; tried different browsers but all crash when opening links from the app. 2) The app sometimes opens other answer when I click on another answer. The same problem happens on my friend's phone too. Please fix it.",negative
I happened upon this app one day and have been EXTREMELY Happy with it!! It's hard to break away sometimes because there's ALWAYS something amazing to read!!!,positive
"no longer works. Does not respond to touch screen, cannot open questions or answer them. Uninstalled it.",negative
"well is good app but till now I can't ask question every time I put question ( may need editing may need editing your spelling,phrasing ect I'm not going to do exam?!",negative
I find it quite useful at times but there are criticism as well while being answered/questioned back to back. Thus making it enjoyable too.,positive
"I like the opinions and knowledge interchange, makes it all interesting, sometimes you want more than a concept, sometimes is about to know how think or feel common people( like myself) and what are their visions of life, points of view... how much wisdom or knowledge they(we) have...is what you need sometimes instead of reading a concept on a book...",positive
I really enjoy doing the answers for people. I also like reading the questions. I love it and it gives me more excitement than my Facebook.,positive
I am using this for quite long period and really loving the way people are getting their answers. Our questions are really answered by some great personalities in that particular field. I suggest this application to get make more elegant way to connect with people who are asking questions with people who are providing them with answers.,positive
The notifications displayed by this app gets accumulated and keeps on adding up instead of clearing them everytime I click the notification bar.,negative
The web version forces me to use the app but the app is far worse than anything. Does not load all the images. At least let us use the web version.,negative
"I've been using it since a long time and obviously it is far better than Facebook, Instagram etc..you'll get all the answers of your questions related to your lifestyle.... Loved it...",positive
"with the last update, Quora is unable to show more than 3 answers in any topic and at the home no more than 5 answers. we can't reload more answers after getting to the bottom of the page",negative
i face some problem while using these app after update it..articles arent open easily whereas i have good network..so consider my problem if there is any issue with app..i am avid reader of this app..,negative
initially used to be a very nice and helpful app but now it is also dominated by influential people as you cannot write the actual truth regarding anyone who is in high authority.,negative
"Downloaded to give a one. I really like Quora and have had and read it on my mail through the gmail app or browser but now, in the middle of an interesting topic, I get a prompt telling me to download the app and there's no way to shut this down or keep reading without downloading the app. I completely detest when apps first gives me a good experience and then tried to force me to do something. Takes away everything good about it for me. Needed you guys to be aware, cheers.",positive
Surely the best app I have ever seen. you can get the the perfect answer to any question you have and can also answer others questions.,positive
Good Way of hands on learning experience in the process of creating the best of the better in the field of a vision for all.,positive
If only Quora PMs could understand the meaning of User Experience on an App. Text selection doesn't work beyond paragraph and the new sharing feature is so useless And dont even get me started on Ads This Knowlegde app has turned itself into another Ad crazy platform,negative

really i liked. certain answere are really good and thourughly researched. now quora is my companion during my journey all the way.,positive
It's a really good idea. I love it. But I think developer should notice the quality of app! #PublicDemand,positive
very good platform for sharing knowledge.. this app teach you lot of things and give you reasoning behind lot of interesting things...,positive
I am using this app and website for quite sometime now but been asked to debate so app gets few more permissions. Don't understand why I'd have to do that. 3 stars are for the content and two due tithe unreasonable permissions required to continue using it.,negative
So.... Cute and very modernization of users involvement. Totally different and peculiar methods of proceedings. Congratulations.üéé,positive
very good and etertaining. i like reading what people post. But i am not able to post anonnymously. is there a reason for that? i haven't done anything that i would think would get that feature blocked for me =/,positive
I don't particularly like the app but what drives me insane is the marketing. Every so often the mobile site displays an ad for the app and will not let you return to reading. You have to close the site and reopen it and then search for what you were previously reading. This always takes time and sometimes is hopeless. Why do they do this? So aggravating.,negative
this is to bring to your kind attention that the users are not able to open the Medium Articles via medium App. that is when we try to open the app through medium a error pops up saying unsuppprted uri schemeüòë. It would be great to see this error fixed asap. thanks,negative
"For forcing me to install the app. You people preached of a free knowledge world and what not . Now you are not allowing us to consume the contents from the good old browser. Whenever I scroll till the 3rd or 4th post, the popup to install the app comes up and there's no way to make it go away. Refresh the page and the current content is lost forever. Just a big thumbs down to you guys.",negative
"why are you forcing users to download app, i was browing quora on mobile and suddenly a pop up appeared to install the app. there is no way that i could dismiss the pop up. this is really unwise and ridiculous.",negative
"very useful , takes education to a whole new level and gaining knowledge is so very easy.",positive
"I use to enjoy this app, however as of lately it's sticking alot and refuses to refresh until being prompted to atleast several times.",negative
old version was good since the up votes were visible. now the topics and related to what i search on Google and seems biased based on advertisement. Not interesting anymore.,negative
just easy to get some wonderful stories and pretty knowledgeable information.,positive
Quite interesting the topics..didn't think that I will enjoy reading the articles in there but as the days goes I look forward to read what people shared and find that I too can share and contribute my views. A great app indeed!,positive
"Forcing me to install an app when I prefer to browse on chrome - that's called desperate design. Don't need the bloat of every single website as an app - that's what internet browsers are for. For having the gall to think this is anything but extortionate, will never download this app - ever.",negative
"My favorite site hands-down for reading and learning about a wide variety of both curious and popular topics. Quite addicting, also.",positive
"overall, an awesome place with varieties of facilities but some moderation policies are senseless... otherwise thanks!!",positive
"Is a DARK THEME ever possible? Except for being a complete ripoff the website, it hardly provides any extra features.",negative
This is a very good platform for asking others for your queries and for solving other's queries as well.,positive
"Quora is an awesome place to share stories, ask questions, give advice and otherwise interact with one of the most diverse user bases I've ever known. For me, it's a place to talk to people I normally wouldn't ever get the chance to, and to give advice on an incomprehensible array of topics and it makes fantastic toilet material.",positive
"It was all good, i enjoyed reading answers but now quora does not work on slow connections, the answer however loads but to read the full answer, the ""Read more"" button never displays the full answer in slow connection, kindly do something",negative
Why do u guys force us to download the app. That download popup after reading just two articles is so annoying.,negative

great app. love it. but please fix this problem where when I try to touch a topic (when I'm scrolling through and see one I'm interested in) sometimes it doesnt let me click on it. it's like it freezes but i can still scroll but cant click on any topic unless I close and re open the app.,positive
"It would have been 5 stars, until two years ago. At that time, experts in their field would answer well-phrased questions about their specialism. Nowadays, if selective, there is still plenty to read and learn from - but there are many very negative questions. Trolls abound. Hence it is 4 stars and, in time, will be 3 or 2 stars - unfortunately.",negative

"Great app! Albeit uncomfortably buggy. In more than 70% of the time I use the apps, tapping on answers in the main feed or feed after searching does nothing. the only way to fix the error is to close the app completely, and then losing track of where you were. it's very annoying. please fix thanks! I am using a Huawei P20 lite",negative
before articles are deleted apparently for violation of policy it is not hightlighted which part of the policy is violated. if it is done it will help a person to avoid that in future articles. As of now it does not appear to be transparent.,negative

Honestly, you're as bad as Facebook. What the hell do you NEED me to install the damn app for? So you can track my location? What? Ridiculous.",negative
"Worst among the most popular apps. So clunky user interface. Difficult to navigate & find things. It recently asked me if i know a certain language.

In such circumstances, I have noted that Quora many a times provides an insight from a fellow member who has a level of expertise or experience which permits dissemination of knowledge on that particular aspect one seeks inputs on. I heartily recommend Quora, even if you just want to browse your areas of interest or offer your insights on a topic. More power!",positive
Such a nice application so much to share and learn easy to use... and easy to get connect the world class thoughts,positive

Images do not load even on decent internet connection. Please fix it. Quora don't deserve this filthy app.",negative
"may be this app is become more comfortable if it is having dark mode , because whenever i started reading , it is very stressful to me to read , even after i set the brightness to low so it is my suggestion to qoura developer team to bring this feature in qoura - dark mode except this app is very useful and awesome platform to express your experiences",neutral

If you want to learn or spread your knowledge, this is the place to go.",positive
i hate that for every website i need to install seperate app where as i can open them in chrome. quora makes it compulsory and blocks me from reading online on chrome mobile. i hate it when there is an option and i can't use that because of these people who decide what we need to do,negative
this bought the most harrassing app i have ever seen..why do i need the app to view the spam email you send?i was actually reading good story comfortably from my browser..when you pop your (download app)or don't continue reading thang ..wow like thats going to get me to download and use your app..you will continue to be spam and a deleted app..one star for the good story..and im a republician ..you would have me blocked anyways..seems yaw conicide on the left.

I'm learning alot of new things from this app. it's a little confusing to me to navigate through it. I think that just maybe my issue. but if you enjoy reading other opinions on the topic you are interested in. This is your app. I didn't give it a 5 because I'm still fairly new using it.,neutral
"Quora is exciting and informative! It can answer any question my inquisitive mind seeks an answer to. Love it!! (The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was because the ads, though necessary, are so irritating.)",positive
"For everyone complaining about ""harassment"" because, halfway through an article, you are asked to download the app, just go in desktop view on chrome.

I got half the way through it. and all the sudden ""its better on the app"" aggressive, aggravating permanent pop add. Im deleting after I read it.

With every new update. The app becomes worse. Earlier quora used to work so smooth but nowadays it's just filled with lags. whenever we open some answers a plain white screen pops up and you have to close the application and open it again to view that answer.,negative
Annoying pop-up on web UI for download the app and there is no way to close it. I'm in the midle of reading something and this behavior is unacceptable.,negative
I enjoy my daily feed from my email and read contributions from my email. Halfway through reading your popup demands that I install the app and doesn't provide the ability to dismiss the notification. I'm not a large consumer of applications. I'm not going to use this app. I will unsubscribe from the daily emails before I start using this app so please don't force it on us. Also... stop asking to show me feeds in other languages. I've already said no; more times than I care to.,neutral
Very addictive. Asking and answering meaningful and silly questions is my favorite thing ever.,positive

"Why should I have to go through google every time! They want my permission to go through my photos, my contacts, my everything on my mobile phone! Why is this necessary for google to do this to me?!?",negative
if you really want your app to shine then create a dark mode. reading small text with bright light at night is very stressful for eyes.,negative
"I have been observing this issue from last 2 updates, that whenever you search something and tried to click on the search results, the whole search screen becomes un clickable and so does the main screen after this. The only way to recover from this is to close the app and remove it from recents and reopen it.",negative
"Been a reader since the beginning but fell off due to content being too personalised. Bubble thinking. Same thing over and over. Today decided to read the email digest and then half way through, blocked by a download app prompt. Can't dismiss it. Nope. Nice try using the content to hook people. I understand investors emphasis on metrics and MAUs. Unfortunately hard to monetize. I understand, but this optimisation for ""funnel conversion"" has gone too far. It demeans ppl.",negative
"Pathetic example of forceful app download, since a stupid pop-up won't let you read anything on site. If you are also victim: install, rate 1 and uninstall",negative
"I downloaded this app just so I could give it one star. Here's a hint, Quora. Don't pop up a notification that can't be dismissed while I'm randomly reading a post that came out of nowhere and interested me. It's just gross. I don't want to download your stupid app, I just want to read the random post that crossed my path and be on my way.",negative
bad experience the app after new update doesnt open in my phone it keeps on displaying a message that android webvuew has stopped since one week iam facing this problem,negative

App doesn't feel light and I didn't like the UI of this much. Also please introduce Dark Theme.,negative
Very interesting -many of the stories are absolutely heartbreaking and many filled with humour. Never fails to amaze me how strong people are despite all the worry and heartache they endure -often puts my own troubles into perspective.-am more or less confined to bed just now and have passed many a sleepless night on Quora --extremely dislike some of the sites but no one is forcing me to read their contents!,positive
"I'm giving one star because I just wanted to read peacefully on my browser and you forced me to install the app if I wanted to continue reading. I would give fifty one star rating if I had a lot of free time. That's how annoying I think what you did was, forcing me to install the app. Let people who want to use the browser to read the content do what they want.",negative
"Downloaded to rate a zero. Can no longer enjoy topics via email because halfway through an interesting topic, a popup would appear forcing me to download app. When I back out and try to find the topic again, it's lost. Not cool!",negative

It used to be a great app but now it is full of fake stories.Not all answers are fake but recently there has been a surge of fake posts.,negative

For The New Version: The UI refresh is good. Please introduce Dark Mode! The Daily Digest feature is simple Awesome. Keep up the Good Work!,positive
"I'd not rate it 1 star even. It's not at all as it was used to be. First of all, I'm pissed off with the continuous prompt that appeared on my chrome browser to install Quora app, to continue. I actually got a meaningful answer, after so many days in my feed. So many ads, vague answers, many things which diluted the quora experience. I was an active user since 2015. But, I don't feel like using it now. Look into it.",negative

Real name required?

"Quora offered to use Hindi too as a language and since I feel both English & Hindi are like my first languages I opted for it. However, after a while it was as if no updates came in English & mostly all of them were in Hindi. The Hindi questions & discussions were a shade or a degree lesser in content, maturity & intellect in comparison to its English counterpart. Having said this I donot mean to hurt or demean the sentiments of the vast Hindi intellects. Just the bars need to be raised.",neutral
"While typing in the question description or answer box, the cursor tends to get erratic and jumps between places after I start a new line by pressing 'enter' key.

The languages can be moved in ""You"" next to ""Profile"", to make the interface clean. There are more suggestion but text limitation",negative
"Very good app to help get your questions answered and answer those of others, but when you have a lot to say. The app force closes when you're writing a very long answer.",positive

Quora has become marketing platform with no moderation and people just pasting content just to promote their product or service and they don't care of providing true information. i have found thst user create question and they give solutions of that question. isn't it funny. Before i used to spend more time on quora but currently it doesn't feel i productive to spend time on Quora. It's like Quora loosing its authenticity,negative

Quora is a great platform for sharing ideas with the world and having an awesome android app makes the job a lot easier.   I reviewed the app around 2- 3 years ago at that time the app was around 100 mb in size with not this much functionality but now it is much smaller in size and now it is loaded with features.  It's a great improvement by the Quora android app developers and you guys deserve 5 start rating.  Keep it up and keep improving the app.,positive

"I thought I had stumbled into a club where you ask a question and people with knowledge volunteer an answer. I thought it was a tool for learning material that otherwise must be searched out in books. In reality, it is a soap-box.

"The concept of the app is very good. But I never got a single answer of the questions posted by me. So the app is becoming annoying for me day by day. I think its community is not qualified at all. All profiles with high qualified bio are FAKE. If they were real they could give a single answer of my questions. As bcz they are fake,to disguise their illiteracy they never answer my qstns. Even after requesting answrs frm some profiles suggstd by quora, I never got ansrs. Don't download this app.",negative

"Most unfriendly user interface. It takes ages to load when you are traveling whereas all other apps including YouTube work just fine. I don't understand if the cellular network is strong enough to play videos smoothly, why can't this bloody quora load? It's recommendation algorithm sucks. Opened questions related to bollywood twice or thrice now my feed is loaded with bollywood and celebrity questions. Posting questions sucks big time. Good concept but worst app. Wake up developers!",negative
"The app hangs every few minutes. Have to restart it. Also, the Logout key needs to be more prominent. Drains phone battery very fast.",negative
"The app of the Quora Portal. If you like the Quora portal, you will either like or love this app, as it is very clean and well-designed. Low RAM consumption adds to the excellent work on this app.",positive
"BUG! When I click on a notification in the notifications tab, I am taken to the post but when I press the back button to return to the list of notifications, I am taken to the feeds tab and the notifications tab just contains the post that I was taken to from the notification. There's no way to go back to the list of notifications as the tab is frozen. Only way is to restart the app, but again the same thing happens when I tap on another notification.",negative
"Please fix opening links from your newsletters. I see an interesting answer in the email, push the link (has the answer's hash in it), the app opens up at the question, 100+ answers and the interesting one from the email is not at the top... After skipping tens of answers I give up searching. I'll avoid those newsletters until the fix comes.",negative
"Not a good practice to force people to use app instead of browser, not even considering that app is slower in loading posts. Edit : at least provide a changelog for updates /\",negative
Quora is the best place to get information on life! Many wonderful people uniting to help each other with thier knowledge and experiences. A beautiful connection for people who have questions and need assistance. I am thrilled to be apart of the Quora Team.,positive
"First off, Quora is an awesome platform for sharing information in a rather healthy way. But this app is garbage. It lacks the accessibility the main site has and it always seems to stop functioning properly. My main problem is how suddenly I can't click on anything and while doing that I'll randomly upvote, hide, or open things I don't want to. And if I upvote something I want nothing to do with, I can't undo it. If these problems can be fixed, I'll consider increasing my rating.",negative
"Easy and fun way to share information. There are a wide variety of users, which means the info is from diverse sources.",positive
"It's funny, Quora forces you to download the slow, dull, feature-lacking Android app that gets stuck if you are trying to use it. The browser-based mobile version of Quora works more efficiently than their app. It has all the features, works faster and is more exciting and userfriendly than their app. Quora, don't force me to download your stupid useless app. I want the mobile site. I will find a way to block your pop-up",negative
"App doesnt work properly. The feed doesnt load half of the time and if you want to browse Quora on the net , it forces you to install the app .",negative
The overall experience is everything I ever wished for. Maybe some more genres can be added to it.,positive
"hate when for same experience as browser, u force to install app and block web access with stupid popup which exits browser. unethical i think.",negative
"I would have really appreciated it if the suggestion to download the app happened before I started reading the article, and perhaps after downloading the app I get redirected back to what i was reading. I like quora as a platform, the design of the app could have been more considerate to its users.",neutral
It is a place for continuous learning and sharing of life changing experiences. I love this app!,positive
"I will not use this app until they do like every other platform and allow you to answer questions under a blog name. They only allow ""mature"" businesses to use their business name. I will not support an app that has no interest in helping it's users establish their online presence. If you can't support me when I'm starting out, I can't support you when I'm established.",negative
for a month unable to pen down answers. as soon as i click on write answer it stops working its irritating,negative
"Absolutely engaging. One of the very few apps out there one can invest significant time in without the guilt of wasting it on social media. Of course, it is always a good idea to fact-check independently, although most of the answers are well cited to begin with. Quora is also relatively neutral politically - some snark sneaks through, but it is typically innocuous. The app is stable as well; I've yet to have any issues with crashing or freezing.",positive
After the latest update today all the previous notifications have disappeared and since morning no new notification has also not come,negative
"Great app with interesting people to follow. I would give it more stars if the app stops suggesting me to follow Quora CEO every time I follow someone. How is this guy even faintly related to my interests? App content needs more filtering, I see some stupid questions posted.",positive
Please make the app interface cleaner like before. there are many unwanted ads and icons on screen making it look way too fancy . keep it as minimalistic as possible.,negative
"This is the best app I've ever used. It can be addictive, but being educational, that's actually better. I've learned a lot here; it's fun. Recommend this in place of any other social media.",positive
"I literally only got this app to say the pop-up ad that shows up in the website version is ridiculous. The ad will pop up in the middle of almost every answer I read, with the only option being to download the app. You can't even close it out, thereby forcing you to exit the answer you got invested in and never read the rest of it. It was more convenient for me to use quora on my email, but I've since stopped because Quora is now more annoying to be involved with than it is insightful or fun :(",negative
they are degrading the quality of this application. now.it contain more ads than the content.,negative
I love being able to take my real life experiences and help others better understand things I know about better. I'm sure I could have written that better. it covers a large assortment of subjects and I am able to find out about almost anything I want.,positive
"My account was flagged because they thought i had a fake name. I sent an email to them (from the email i used for my account, not the one im reviewing with) and they told me to send an id. My account clearly stated that I was 14 so i dont have one and cant get one cause i have no proof of my date of birth. Now I cant even use the app. Im extremely dissapointed.",negative
Its really one of the best platforms to get answers of most of the questions. Really like it.,positive
difficult to navigate. It would be three star if i didn't get a pop up on my phone demanding i use this sub par app.,negative
Forcing to download the app when you can use the same in any browser with proper sign in.... It is irritating when you use a 1 GB RAM basic phone with limited memory,negative
"Given it a try, received notifications everyday for posts and articles added years ago with pages and pages of replies. It's like reading an old newspaper you found under the bath, mildly amusing but soon thrown in the bin.",negative
"I have found it to be intelligent conversations about different things, which is a rare thing in this world. Some of the questions I don't bother with because they're stupid, but for the most part it's intelligent people seeking intelligent information. One thing I've had trouble with is learning how to operate the app. I still don't know how to get to some things. It would be nice if there was a button where are you could look for things.",neutral
The biggest platform to express yourself. To find the answers of those question which can not be found on google. Really a mindblowing creation.,positive
recent time... there is bug in app. it shows one notification. even if there is none or more than one. fix it asap.,negative
Absolutely wonderful app and great interface. You can find out what others have to say about questions being asked. Alot of useful information and opinions.,positive
"I spend a lot of time on Quora so I suppose I'm more likely to see the app's quirks. Some ""improvements"" seem counter-intuitive. ... but I use it.",neutral
"QUORA is a medium of Sharing, Exploring through out the Globe! Yes, I do Agree. QUORA is a medium of Enthusiasm, which gives us Past, Present and Future Knowledge in Depth... I want to say, it takes us to the Extent wherever, whatever we wanted to go with Our Vision, Appetite for Getting Knowledge by sharing, and pass on to the next Enthusiasts. Really I Enjoyed a lot with the medium of Quora:Sharing, Interacting, Reading the Information from Highly Knoledgeable, Experienced Personalities! üëçüôèüíê",positive
App looks aesthetically pleasing and clean while also functioning very well.,positive
"Crashes everytime I try to start the app Been using the website on my pc for years but the app just doesn't want me to use it; tried reinstalling 3 times, didn't work",negative
"Gee, I sure do love being forced to download an unnecessary app just to read a website on mobile because it gives literally no option to click the popup advertising the app away.",negative
"I like the whole idea of Quora, but this app sucks! It almost always doesn't let me type, and doesn't work when I press buttons and it's always slow! And I know it's not a problem with my phone because it ONLY happens on the Quora app, and it works perfectly fine if I use Web version.",negative
"It's the best social app you can get! It's community remains up-to-date, and you can get help in any field by experienced people.",positive
Best app in universe ever made very helping. any matter any topic can be read easily very helpful. It helped me choosing right stream after 10th.,positive
Hi this app is best for share of knowledge. i like this app but now the app is not working properly. i uninstall the app and download again but not work. APP is saying for login and i do that but app aging -again saying for signing,negative
"App has become too cluttered, useful space is only half the window, 960 out 1920 pixels are what you are actually reading right now, and 960 are advertisement, big X button, top menu with notifications, all of which you don't care about. When you read post one answer is an actual answer, then advertisement with the same design as answer, then link to another thread already with its answer that you may confuse with current thread and only then you get to another answer to your current thread.",negative
Very useful app. We get to learn something new from others and we can share our knowledge or experiences with others as well.,positive
"Used to work better. Lately, freezes up constantly and doesn't allow you to link to answers when searching a subject. Can't find any help within the app for technical difficulties. Has potential, but needs major UI overhaul.",negative
"Love it. It really helps me understand how different can people think. For psychology, is fantastic!",positive
"I hereby protest against Quora's approach of strongarming users into using their app by an uncloseable, intrusive popup on their mobile site. The mobile app itself is just average crappy: lacks features and jumps away from where I was in the feed quite often. Nice way of telling me I don't matter.",negative
"An app build for sharing and gaining knowledge. Though some users ask stupid questions, you can always ignore that. Best way to connect with people.",positive
I love giving and getting advice. I enjoy the spirited debates on topics - as long as we all remember opinions are seldom right or wrong. :),positive
"The app is fine. However this doesn't need to be an app. It's literally a question and answer website. Rating it one star because having it cut me off, while I'm using a browser, to tell me to download the app and then completely disabling all functionality on the site so it's nothing more than a pop up saying to download the app is terrible. I don't want the app on my phone taking up space when I can just go to the website. Terrible decision.",negative
It won't load when I click on the email link. I try to open via web browser and your site won't let me read till the end because I need to install or open in the app which is a stupid idea. And still the app won't load. This is stupid.,negative
exceptional apps.. really helpful and could be use by everybody. a second place to ask questions after Wikipedia,positive
"I'm using it from an year about and m very happy to say that if you have any sorts of issue or dubious about anything ( especially related to career ) you can go for it blindly ! and it can even help you in multiple case by answering your personal issues too ... and the interesting part is that you can even guide others by answering their questions , just select your choice which type of questions you can give answer of i.e personal or health tips or career related and thus you can help other too",positive
"pathetic app.....half of the time it gets hang suddenly or many times image doesn't load, etc.",negative
"Insightful to read the diverse views and opinions on common issues, whether on economics, politics etc. Its fun & entertaining to me but do be careful of fake or overbearing views.",positive
I'm only leaving this review for 1 reason. The website is telling me constantly to install the app when I frankly don't want to so I'm leaving a neutral score but saying that's it annoying that my feed is getting interrupted by it telling me to get the app,negative
there is some bug that make you cant click the search result..and it happen constantly fix it please,negative
"this app sucks. it is crazy slow, freezes up when you do a search, and you cant share a post to a text message. i like to read the questions on quora but the app is so bad that it distracts from what would be a great idea if the app was better.",negative
Quora is great platform but they still need to work on their app. It needs a better user interface and dark mode is a neccesity.,negative
"This one of the most app I'm spending my time on when I'm using my smartphone, I'm facing problem while I'm reading in night, hope you can add dark mode as an option similar to other apps like Twitter and YouTube. Appreciate the effort you're doing.",positive
"An interesting forum. But I do have concerns about poor verification of factual content. In my own area of expertise , there are numerous prominently displayed posts of false or misleading information. So I must carefully decide which sources to trust when browsing other topics.",negative
"The quora mobile site forces you to download the app half way through reading an answer. There is no choice to not. You can't stay using their website. I believe this is deeply unprincipled, and a really ugly way to run a business. It's also short sighted, as it relies on deliberately annoying your customers into doing what benefits you more than them. What do you think happens when a competitor pops up with a customer orientated philosophy? Add a choice to the popup to stay on the browser.",negative
Earlier the app used to be so good and smooth. Now I don't know what the hell developers has done. They have now just degrading it after each update. Now its not smooth as it used to be. So much lags and problems. And manier times it shows quora is temporarily unavailable.,negative
"Good app, easy to use, and is pretty robust. Quora is an interesting site, mostly good useful stuff, but inevitably a few idiots too (they are definitely in the minority though).",positive
"I thoroughly enjoy the questions and answers on Quora. I notice, also that my trivia quiz club enjoys and uses Quora, also. I often find Quora listed in Reader's Digest articles, too.",positive
Really it is an awosome app!!!:) You find answers of your questions by people here. But I have one problem and that is the layout in the app and the coustmisation is really odd and sometimes it makes working on app nearly impossible.....,positive
"They make you download the app even though the website works perfectly fine. They will have a pop up if you browse it on their website that goes ""Download the App"" that you can't close. Such a dick move.",negative
"good place to scratch your head and share ideas and theory. No, you don't have to be a genius, just thoughtful and curious.",positive
Do you why people uninstall stubborn and aggressive apps which always run in the background wanting to connect to the internet. You have that annoying thing. uninstalling.,negative
"i like reading the posts. it keeps my ""problems"" in perspective and reminds me that i have a pretty great lifeüòä",positive
Fun! and is good for charachter building and to build knowledge and self esteem. And to make a little money too!,positive
not so convenient to use. cannot give descriptions for the question. home page not sleak and tidy.,negative
"hate being forced to download it, the website is much better designed, the app is going to need some big changes, almost everything is annoying",negative
I love Quora... But why the hell do I have to download it forcefully... The ad popup on the browsers... It's like the worst ever... I'm downloading the app just to give this review... Thank you Quora for your cheapest technique...,negative
"A perfect social networking platform, need of some bug fixes as this app runs slow on doing multiple actions at a page or section. it runs extrwmely when we give instant and continious commands. provide the bug fixes.",negative
I spend hours a day just reading stuff in this app! The graphics and layout are simple and functional. What makes it really great is the wide array of topics answered and experiences shared by the members.,positive
App has stopped showing stories. i think there is some bug because it wouldnt show any feed from last 1 week.,negative
This is a useful app. Whenever some doubt on any subject you can always refer this. You will get a good idea about the thing.,positive
The concept of the app is fantastic. but the app should be smoother & simple to understand.,positive
"It's an amazing app if you are a knowledge seeker. But there must be some more features. There must be a feature to download shared images . Because, Quora is such platform where we get some very unique stuff.",positive
So far so good. I would really like to have a dark mode. One star less is because we are FORCED to download the app.,positive
"quora is the best community surface so far so simple and doesn't require too much work to get to where you want, all good the only thing I'm not on them with is the app update require everytime there is a new update",positive
"one star? yes. why? because of the intrusive ass pop up that forces me to download this app. ""Eff"" your app. It's not necessary.",negative
No problem with the app but forcing me to download it in the middle of reading an article ruins the total experience!,negative
What is the point of forcing me to download this flaky app then taking me back to the browser every time I click on a link. The whole concept seems to consist of brainless Americans asking inane qestions about the UK or other European countries with equally inane answers. I am going to uninstall this app and deregister from the site. It is a total waste of time and effort.,negative
This app is really handy and here you can search any query that you have in your mind and even its the best place to practice writing.,positive
"It is one of the coolest app. I am using this last one year. It is connect with much educated people. But my issue is, where its downloaded articles will shown.",positive
Not smooth. Sometimes when I search for a topic and I press it it does not respond. Very annoying. Hope you can solve this problem ASAP!!!,negative
"I love to answer and asking questions on this platform,it is the best way to explore the knowledge of other people ,this network signifies sharing is caring in respect of knowledge.",positive
"I really prefer the browser version so much better since the app is so slow and confusing. It's damn annoying being suffocated with ads forcing you to download the app. The browser version is so much better. I was reading the best damn answer and this damn ad just stuck on my screen, couldn't even remove it to bookmark the answer. The website itself is amazing though, with such great writers and whatnot but for the love of God please stop smotherin me, I'm using the browser version for a reason.",negative
"Stability, please. It's heavier to scroll Daily Digest stories, reading comments, language to bounce btwn original post & translated one (loop) and so on, much it glitched & lose what I wanted to see, Daily Digest in email comes handy. Super wonky to write & edit draft on phone, such a hassle. Edit: it's still an issue but now: Answers/Space to reshare & upvote in my dashboard, why didn't any of it get recorded on my Activity, even ones I upvoted as ""bookmark"" because no such bookmark, yet.",negative
"This app is addicting. I would liken it similar to wiki, except for in a simple question-answer format. It's set up to do be social, you can have followers, friends etc. It's easy to see qualifications, both professionally, and personally, when they either ask or respond to a question.",positive
"The app crashes with ""TRY AGAIN"" message and has a few bugs that breaks my device. And overall performance is slow too. Bad UI.",negative
"Quora as a platform is wonderful, but when you load it up with ads indistinguishable from the regular content, it becomes nasty",negative
"Hi team Quora, the best app that I learned many things from. The idea is really awesome. Instead of wasting my time in social media I use Quora to gain my knowledge. I've got to read many people's experiences and learned it before I facing it. But I'm reading more and more to write Atleast a proper story of my experience.",positive
"Quora is an interesting app, in that it has in general a lot if interesting questions, people, information. But there's a huge and very annoying pitfall that I've found in it. You never quite know when your answer will step on a land mine with their policy and get deleted by support. It will be really petty reasons, such as, they thought your image that had text on it was a meme. Please look up what a meme is, Quora. They also move answers a lot, which is mega annoying. Not impressed.",negative
Wow ! the app is buggy.i can't scroll and even comment sometimes. and i can't use quora without app. keeps asking me to install the app. these people !üôÑ Pfft! Uninstalled and unsubscribed. Not coming back to these money minded people. I'll certainly miss fellow quorans!,negative
it's a excellent app. I got to know so many experiences and gained so much knowledge from it. üòä,positive
"Biggest turn off is the newsfeed and this new hunch of quora to become twitter insta etc at the same time. I didnt follow someone to get all of his movement , I've tried modifying my feed and I'm constantly trying to filter it down to most relevant stuff but it's not learning at all. i hope they'll do something about it. Quora used to be different and an asset now it's becoming redundant to me.",negative
"though it is a good collection of Q&A, the navigation and i formation organization is not very intutive. For eg if a user has asked a question, he has to go i side his profile to see the answers. also, he cant delete a question if his question is replied to. Too much of questions from adverts, which looks like real question. My answers tab shows the number 4, but when i go into it, i cant see which 4 answers itis referring to. the information on this app needs a major reorganization.",negative
"even though i have a pretty strong internet connection, somehow i come to an end of feed in the app. No more questions load when scrolled to the bottom and i then have to to back to the top to find any new feed if any.",neutral
"I really love the concept of Quora itself. I've found articles that relate to my problem very well and I learn a lot. However, I was using the browser version and it suddenly asked me to download the mobile app in the middle of my read. I couldn't close out of it so I downloaded. I thought the app was cool and convenient, until I saw how buggy and glitchy it is... Really a disappointment.",positive
"I was trying to read the browser version of the site when a pop up to download the app appeared -no close button, clicking on the side of the pop up etc did not help and going back and then forth into the thread i was reading just resulted in the same pop up appearing. I do not appreciate being forced to download apps.",negative
This app is the best for getting personal advice on any topic whatsoever. I've been using it for over a year now and I always turn to it whenever I need valuable advice. The experience is truly awesome.,positive
"The app is amazing. I love how you get to spread your opinion and help other people. The main reason I love the app is because everyone can share ideas and opinions to help other people. This is just simply amazing. There can be so much good to come just by sharing thoughts and opinions. The good part is anyone can do it spread their idea. You get a variety of answers from people with degrees that match yours, to people that match your age limit or not. So you can base your answers off of this.",positive
"Sometimes unusable. Wherever you touch, it'll be going back to the top.",negative
amazing to connect with other people. on how they encourage you in a speacial way. it is nice to talk ko strangers about your problems and asking for some advices. i hope i can learn alot from them and i feel like im not alone anymore.,positive

"I wanted to spend time on the Quora website via my browser. instead, they cut me off halfway through the first post im reading and tell me to use the app. The last time I tried to open a link to a question using the app, it didnt even bring me to the question. this is how it goes: Quora sends me an email with some questions I might be interested in. I am interested in a question and try to read more. Quora doesn't let me. I'm tired of having open ended conclusions to my experience. uninstalling",negative
"worst app, always unresponsive. never loads images no matter how fast the internet is never seen such a worse app should give it zero stars",negative

"I love the way Quora organises the whole question answer thing. I love to add value to the readers and help them. As a Certified Life Coach, it gives me great satisfaction to be able to help people with different answers. Keep it up Quora.",positive
Great app filled with knowledgeable people. I always learn something new and get revelations from their experiences. Such sweet supportive people pursuing wisdom.,positive
"The experience is wonderful, you get your questions answered by people who have been there and done that, and on top of it you too can share your views/answers with other people.. the only thing which bothers me is its authenticity, who knows what people are posting is ryt or wrng, I guess quora team should do something about it otherwise it is a fantastic appüòõ",positive
"Great concept and partner program however app itself gives me error codes at least once a day. Also seems to crash during high traffic hours, I'm assuming",negative
It is very useful app to my studies. It can solve any type of questions in a simple manner.I liked it very mush‚ò∫Ô∏è,positive
Please give users the option to not download the app; I just want to read an answer or two when I get the daily digest without neing forced to install an extra app on my phone.,neutral
best app but still it needs to fix some bugs such as the topics which you define in your profile .its some times gives errors.so may b ill give4.5/5 to this app..,negative
"I used to browse Quora a lot in my spare time. now they are requiring me to get an app in order to read the questions, why would I bother. If it was optional, I'd consider downloading it and continuing to read at my leasure. but by forcing it down our throat, you're making me not want to stay.",negative
I'm part of the partner program but I'm unable to link my PayPal. This is quite frustrating.,negative
Great application for spreading knowledge and personal experience. Loving it.,positive
fine experiences with a thrust of knowledge i get from various sources and people who are doyen in their fields participate. This is highly commendable. my best wishes to this app,positive
app doesnt allow you to use its only funcation and always has some sort of problem. after awhile all it causes is frustrasion which isnt worth the stress.,negative
"This might only be my perception, but....it seems that recently there have been more questions posted which are either troll posts or very low quality in vocabulary and spelling. Perhaps it may be appropriate for moderators to defer posts to authors for correction and/or editing before they are accepted for posting.",negative
the new interface block bottom part leaving less space for the content being read especially if reading shared post,neutral
I am trying to read an answer on the browser.(App is already installed on the phone). Annoying notofication to download the app comes again and again. you can not close this motification only can be redirected to the app The answer listing on app and browser is different and hence you never will be able to finish that answer. I have tried thrice to read the answer from browser but every time that same annoying popup if you dont want anyone to see the content on browser then disable accessing it,negative
deeply mind-challenging. informative and educative. keeps my mind fresh and blooming.,positive

I don't like it's Interface much in latest updates hope if it gets improved.,negative
"now a days quara gives 3rd class User Experience. It bother us by its hanging issue n sometimes it doesn't refresh and sometime show white screen. every educational platform has now dark mode, but quara doesn't have. Even they don't have a Good UI designer i think.",negative
"Very nice, informative, people write very well, it is worth reading.",positive
Its just a great concept ! Every Information at one place and way better than other social media apps like Insta and Fb. A must have for mobile users !,positive
I like this app because it helps me build my capabilities by answering difficult questions based on my interest and experience and also learn from other quora user throughout the world for new understanding. Great app.,positive
"Positive. Instead of mindless searching on Facebook (after you've checked it) try spending time on Quora. It's a much more compelling way to learn things...and you might help other people, too!",positive
"Good, avoid unnecessary links, if they Provide direct links to topics like technical, design , psychologyetc it will be awesome",positive
The app has a strong bias towards one specific group of people and political spectrum. not at all unbiased and neutral.,negative
Ad of this app pops up everytime when I open the website of quota totally ridiculous. and I have to download it just because of that.,negative
visiting Quora can be compared to a fine fancy banquet. Always satisfied looking forward for the next course. thank you for the delightful experience.,positive
wonderful app...full of amazing questions but dont know why so less downloads in playstore. It has the potential of becoming a billion downloads,positive
"It's just been a day that i started using quora, but i am totally in love with it. Had there been an option of saving favourites, i would've definitely given 5 stars.  Apart from the tiny short coming, it's insanely brilliant.",positive
"Good. Better. Best. AWESOME. BRILLIANT. OUT OF THE BOX. Whatever you name it, its yet less for this amazing creation. I just love to answer and also improve my knowledge. For me, words are becoming less to describe this beautiful app of KNOWLEDGE.",positive
this is the place we can learn whatever you want to learn her orteach whatever you want to teach there's some good nonsense questions that take a lot of fat to answer it's fun,positive
Its good enough. Except for the mindless banter on silly issues. Feed could do with some improvements. There should be a filter and/or review on the content and intent of the questions asked.,negative
"App Interface looks messy. It's a great app with interesting topics and questions. The interface looks so crowded. Instead of showing the answers directly, just show the question and topic the have people click for the answer, or just minimize the font for the answer. It looks so crowded and messy. It hurts my eyes from reading",negative
"App is weak on Social Media management compared to the desktop browser site but its suitability with user email is fast, easy to access and motivating to explore the site further",positive
"If I could rate this 0, I would. To force people to download an app in order to continue viewing content that is perfectly viewable from the mobile browser is obsurd and downright shameful. Keep doing this and you're going to have more people abandoning the service for alternatives real quick.",negative
Too much ads and popup links. App is useless compared to browser version.,negative
this is the worst fu***** app only because of always flagging the people just because of the reason that they don't use proper name. when you get the required info why do you even need the proper name....I'm fed up with this app and I'm uninstalling it,negative
"This app is good and all but, you cannot force your viewers to switch to the app completely.I started quora through their website, long before their app was established and it became the number 1 website i frequent to. Until the app came around and now everytime i open quora's website, i get a pop up that I can click to redirect me to the app with no way of closing said pop up. This has turned me off completely from traversing through quora as the app experience just isn't the same as the web.",neutral
I absolutely love it i just downloaded it this morning from a random what i thought story heading on Facebook lead me to this wonderful little gem of information on everything from music to mental health you can ask a question and get some great answers from not only qualified experts from each field but people living with or hsving ecperienced in the different topics you can also answer or give your opinion on anything that you want,positive
"A little hard to navigate when you first start using it and it's hard to understand if your question was actually posted or if they want you to edit it first so if they made the app more user friendly I wld have given it a five but it's one of the harder apps to navigate if you plan on asking and answering questions , but if all your going to do is read questions and answers it's a piece of cake..",negative
"Downloaded app simply to rate it. I do not want your stupid app, I like using it from my email and that is it. Now that you have added this stupid button to make me download it, I am going the other way and deleting my membership and will no longer take part in any way. Trying to force people to download your app is a good way of destroying the Quora community. Goodbye!",negative
"I love Quora, So much unbiased info on every subject you can imagine. It's where I spend alot of my time just checking stuff out.",positive
"app doesn't respond properly. upon clicking on the link, it fails to redirect. I have to close the app and reopen several times. it doesn't work properly on redmi note 7 pro.",negative
"Sometimes when I clicking on a post that I want, it doesn't show that post at all. Instead, shows another post way above that post or press something I didn't want to press. I'm not sure why but hopefully it gets fixed.",negative
I always use the browser version and I wanna download it because there is always a pop up link with no close button.,neutral
Great App!I am learning new perspectives from other Quorans who are totally diverse in term of cultural backgrounds.,positive
it's a very good application. it's useful in studies and also I always get new thing and facts to know.,positive
"The Quora site is great fun, often thanks to smart, thoughtful answers to dumb questions. The app itself is frustrating as hell: on this LG phone it regularly hangs right when I'm in the middle of writing an answer so that I can't type even one more character. I have to close and reopen it far too often.",negative
"An amazing app. I just love it, very very helpful application, one can solve any queries here in this application.",positive
wish I had discovered this earlier. fantastic idea ...very helpful and love reading all the advice.,positive
Quora is a good platform. But I am not comfortable with the user's interface of this Android app (may be subjective). I prefer web. But have no time to power on laptop and forced to use this app.,negative
Forcing your users to download your app by shoving huge non interactive pop ups on your mobile website right on your users face isnt a good idea. Not downloading you app.,negative
Literally just got this app to leave a review about how ridiculous your practices are. Will be uninstalling afterwards. People who prefer to use an actual browser to view your content are being blocked with a pop-up that can't be closed out telling people to download your app. This is a sh*tty way to draw people to your app. I can't support an app dev that feel they have to force their consumers.,negative
"I wish ratings could be in negative. I tried to post my question several times and each time it was marked for correction. I checked, rechecked question . It was correct in every sense. I tried posting the question by altering it or even changed it completely but with no effect. Same thing happened with other questions also. Furthermore, I was bombarded with question which needed my answer, I felt like I am working for quora with no reward.",negative
I don't spend as much time on Quora as I used to since there has been a growing number of delusional and irrational Trump supporters and trolls joining the forum. They have a knack (and a mission) to suck the joy out of it. But there are still interesting questions being posed by real individuals.,negative
Really enjoy asking and answering questions. The app works great and the ads are non-intrusive. The site can be addictive.,positive
"A few bugs now and then . . . . A lot of people want a night/dark mode on Quora. Please add it, just give it as an option at least, as in Reddit , Thanks :)",neutral
"Worst app. Everytime i ask a question, i recieve a notification ""improvement needed"". I asked many questions in the simplest way possible bt still i get this notification & there is no answer to my easy questions even after 15 days & after even requesting 20 people for each question, i didn't revieved any answer.",negative
"App is good as base but have number of bugs, I normally gives answers in Quora and gets more then 50 request for answers every week but and I basically like to answer all the questions but the issues i am facing are, sudden crash of app, stop working properly after answering 2 questions or doing some depth searching, Even mobile is working fine still app sucks. hope to see developers solve this problem soon.",negative
"I highly recommend that app to everyone. It gives us Incredible information and experience that which can we use and apply in our real life. Quora is the right platform to share your experience. Whenever I free, I spend my all time on Quara. Quara is the best app. ‚úå‚ù§",positive

"i couldn't verify my email id , whenever i used to answer it ask to verify it ,but it couldn't it always makes error and doesn't send the verification mail.",negative
"It would be a nice app, but all of the geniuses in there want to write their doctoral thesises for answers. i joined to provide info, and get info. The letters after a person's name doesn't mean anything more than they had the wherewithall to finish extra schooling. So, im sure those types will thrive. Suggestion, limmit the space for response. will force people to be more concise . Thank you",positive
please add night reading mode because due to white background it becomes difficult to read at night in the dark.,negative
"I have often found many an answer from Quora but have only just downloaded the app. The way I see it, you can ask any question about life, love or politics and everything inbetween and you will get an answer. I love this app. I've reduced the stars from 5 to 3 and I may even have to uninstall it, I'm getting some severe technical glitches when I open the app, it freezes or goes from page to page without me navigating it. It also opens on its own , I don't like apps that don't behave.",positive
"One of the best apps for exploring topics, with compelling questions. and answers that respect the asker and inspire the reader.",positive
"the app is poorly done, after you click read more instead of expanding on same page, a new page is opened, which introduces unnecessary navigation. Can't use the website on phone and redirects to app each time, The whole agenda of using the app on phone is lost now.",negative
Giving 1 star because qoura literally forced me to downlaod the app making web viewing experience impossible with pop up ad for app.,negative
Super annoyed by the pop up on mobile web that won't let me use the website. I don't want to install another app on my phone. Why can't you guys respect your users' choice?,negative
the pop.up in website version is so irritating. They can do anything to get the app installed. Ridiculous,negative
A good platform for new writers and very helpful for who are finding for solutions of their questions.,positive
"I love your site, but what I do not love is the fact that on my tablet it insists that I download your app. I do not have room for your app on my tablet. I love reading the articles, I am not always on my pc, so when I find an interesting article and I am only part way through it on my tablet the site insists I download your app to finish the article. so I quit reading the article because of that and this not the first time it has happened.",negative
i havent downloaded this app and i never will. if i want to read the stories from my gmail app i damn well should be able to. forcing me to download an app isnt a solution.,negative
"This app is so beautiful, and is an incredible community of advice-givers right at your fingertips. It reflects the original site well, and works great!",positive
Dream App. But its really hangs a lot and shows error.Working on its website is more easy than on app.,negative
"So many amazing and brilliant minds from around the world are here on Quora. I learn something new every single day here. I learn new words, and their meaning. Some of the most fascinating people I've ever heard of are on here. Best social platform out there üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü",positive
It is a challenging platform where you tend to gain massive knowledge and can put yourself at test too by answering questions.,positive
"it sucks. now a days application never shows feed over wifi, also very few stories i get in my news feed. it takes too much time to show any story at all.",negative
"Why forcing user to download the app? One cannot read post via mobile browser in peace. If I dont want to install the app on my phone, you dont have to prevent me from reading content by blocking it with prompt to download without any option to close it thereby forcing the user to download the app.",negative
Good content. Good responses. Too many ads placed in the middle of that content.,positive
my answer to a question was just photos but quora has blocked my answer because it is not in English. After i edited answer and numbered each photo and appealed then also it is telling answer needs to be in english.,negative
"Over all good application, but some time it got stuck during edit. I would suggest everyone to use this application where learning never ends üòä",positive
it's nice platform to learn more things but if u use frequently u will end up in reading the same story again and again by different users. this data science should be improved some more so that we won't feel like this again... once again thanks to the team becoz of this app i learnt more and still learning more... :),positive
"Good app. We do get a few lags though. Especially when I click notifications, I probably have to tap it about 3 times until I get a response but generally very good.",positive
"****Update**** I tried it thinking maybe the app had something the website doesn't. Turns out it does.....BUGS!!! THEY FORCE ME TO DOWNLOAD A CRAPTASTIC APP, AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL!! Zero Stars I haven't used the app yet. I'm giving it 1 star because Quora won't let me access their website via my browser on my phone. When I try, I get a pop up that doesn't close that tells me I have to download their app. No website should ever force me to download their app!",negative
The most important element of civilization is passing/passing down of knowledge and skills to others. If I can spread my knowledge and experience to others the society would advance to a better and higher position. This element together with language and communication have helped the humans to develop and prosper. Quora is a convenient service. It helps us to disseminate knowledge by providing platform for questions from the seekers and answers from the experts.,positive
"its very good if you have a lot of questions. you can see what other people are good at answering. 100% helped me understand thing i was not sure about, you just need to look :)",positive
Some questions are very ridiculous.Some are very informative.Some are funny.And most are biased.Mostly answers are biased and boring.,negative
Above average both in the dispense of knowledge and ease of navigation.,neutral
Forcing readers to install your app when your webpage is doing fine is indequate. Will avoid your webpage from now on.,negative
Developer forcing people to download App when it should be our choice. Annoying popup with no cancellation option. Cannot support such developer.,negative
I find many interesting and unusual questions on Quota. The answers are usually good because they are interested in the subject themselves or have had experience or encounters with the subject matter of the inquirers question. I do wish the whole response would appear all at once when a question is clicked on; instead of having to push read more one or more times. Thomas,positive
"I'm really getting SICK of you trying to force me to download this app. LET ME USE MY BROWSER. I don't want more apps then I need. Its so annoying! Everytime I'm trying to read you put an ad for this app in my face that I can't close or back out of while reading! Seriously, CUT IT OUT. EDIT I uninstalled the app. There are so many other 1 star reviews mentioning the same problem. I would rather NOT read Quora than be forced to download an app. There ARE alternatives. Quora better get it together",negative
Incredibly slow. I wanted to answer a question and I thiught it wasnt loading because my internet was bad so I went to starbucks for their fire WiFi and it still wouldnt load and I realized the app is just THAT slow. Would actually use Quora if the app wasnt so bad.,negative
Exellent! Clear UI and the performance is good.,positive

what's wrong with your app... after 4-5 seconds touch doesn't work on your app ... it's happened only with this app,negative
"The application itself is not bad or something. However, Quora's spam policy (the ""Download the mobile application"" unblockable pop up that prevents you from reading an article on-line) literally forces you to install the application if you want to continue reading, which is completely unacceptable and frustrating to say the least.",negative
"The best platform to gain and share knowledge , experiences and many more.. The app has fee bugs but it's ok",positive
"This is a very informative app whether you have a question to ask, or if you would like to assist and answer someone's question with your personal experience and knowledge! I have learned a lot from this app and I believe I taught and informed many people on this app. The best app to spread knowledge and help each other out! This is by far the best social media site. In my opinion, it's better than the big 3(Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) social networking sites!!! Now that says a lot!!!",positive
not really bad... but it would have been awesome if you guys made it possible to save pictures rather than someone going through the stress of screenshoting it.,positive
"There is a quality in the answers. It is really informative, and majority of the answers seems to be reliable. However, it will be good if the answers are listed in chronological order, so that latest shall come first.",positive
"The app for sure is a good thing....but whenever I try to open quora through my browser and I'm in the middle of reading a great answer, this stupid popup asking to install this app appears....and I can't skip it! How good is it to force an app on the users? At last, I gave in to this stupidity and installed this app! And yeah I repeat the app is quite good! But the way I got to install this app, it is very dissatisfying!",negative
"Quora app is a blackmark on Quora. The app is unreliable and has frequent multi-second halts while writing. I love Quora, but the Android app is not well done.",negative
"I have learned so many things from this app being it a subject or other things.Spending time on quora is way too better than other social media apps.Its not only informative but also entertaining from my perspective.If at all you need any suggestions about any topic for that matter,you will get a great deal of answers,perspectives from the people who are exceptionally specialists in that topic.",positive
Very helpfull app for myself and others. Keep on improving it . I love this app. But sometimes it hangs up.,positive
whenever i open this app i forget to close it. after a while i notice that i'm using it from an hour and sometimes may be 2 or 3 hours..... this app is good and also the people here are educated and genuine. one important thing is that you must follow your needs otherwise some amazing but not useful information kills time. overall it's nice....,positive
"interesting and informative. reading about each one's experiences make us all connected to each other and we realize how similar we are, and that's a wonderful thing!",positive
"it's very interesting, informative and educational if you like that sort of thing and entertaining, don't forget entertaining..",positive
Reduced rating because of not so appealing feature of opening new window to read the whole answer. I'll likely switch to desktop now. Also i am not interested in unlocking all futures so please stop that pop up asking to download app after few seconds of browsing on mobile web.,negative
"When I use quora on Mobile browser, after reading few answers, An ad to Download this Quora app is poping up and I am not able to close it.",negative
"While searching, the app just gets stuck after scrolling a bit making it impossible to open a question to view the answers. It's still possible to scroll though. Happens every time on 3 of my Devices, 2 running Android Oreo and 1 on Pie. Horrible app experience on brilliant content site.",negative
"great platform to get answers of your questions and also helps in increasing your knowledge about different topics, the only things they should have to improve is to allow downloading images if they can.‚ù§‚ù§",positive
I love this app. Great questions answered by anyone who has insight. Not always by experts which is fantastic as it opens up new lines of questioning. A must have for anyone plagued by rampant curiosity.,positive
"You can't use the online mode, an annoying pop up appears prompting you to download the app. Absolutely rediculous. I should be able to browse online, not be forced to download the app.",negative

Not a fan of the fact that they make you use an app when the web browser works perfectly fine. They put up a pop-up that blocks the ability to read the questions on the web browser and force you to download the app. No thanks.,negative
"I love quora! My only complaint is forcing us to download the app from the web version, but otherwise it is good.",positive
"one of the finest interactive applications I have ever used, best part is that you dont see any advertisement at all. Soothing experience and easy to use.",positive
"extreme warning! unbelievably bad.please dont install until you want bugs, harrassment,it contains some profiles of Islamic terrorists whom i have seen in some answers.the ads are also always from fraud sites.and they will delete your answer mostly many times and you will keep filing.terorists answers usually on questions like how to make a bomb like that.which i ofthen used to get.i was totally sick seeing such answers.you can get trapped.it would be better to heed my review.all others are fake.",negative
Fast and easy to operate. Better than previous version. The grouping of themes is very helpful and reduces the use of search function.,positive
"absolutely amazing. the timing and relevancy of the app. incredible.Thank you seems like it is not showing enough gratitude. and appreciation... the reasoning of the initial queation at hand, followed by the shown numbers of likes and reviews.. brought tears to my eyes.. thank you so much for that.. nikola tesla 369. 5stars. amazing things are happening. god bless to all. stay positive dear ones.

Too slow. At least 10x slower compared to google apps.(literally speaking) Works very bad in good network conditions. In bad networks? Imagine.,negative
"Potentially wonderful app gets only 2 stars: it is horribly BUGGY on Android. SCREWS up typing after a few lines of normal. Freezes completely. Difficult to navigate. Add a comment and it is impossible to return to where you were! Impossible to find YOUR comments later unless you remember the exact wording of the original question. NUMEROUS political questions HAVE to be FAKE, or from Russia, because NO ONE is THAT stupid! I also question funding. Does ANYONE from Quora READ these comments?",negative
Images do not load sometimes. Please come up with native app instead of webViews. I hope the developer is reading this review,negative

In the initial times quora helped me to learn new things and as times passes it helped me to share and express my knowledge.. atmost satisfied,positive
"I finally reluctantly got the app since they're desperate enough to harrass you with unmovable popups while browsing the website on mobile, and of course, it's trash. They removed the additional description to ALL questions so it all reads like an unfinished thought. It's no surprise that a Yahoo ripoff would be so tone deaf but quit your job if this was your idea. I won't be using this app again, hope they remove their heads from their rear ends and learn to listen to the consumer. -5 stars",negative
this app freezes all the time. spend more time closing and restarting it than answering questions.,negative

Different type of questions in multiple angles attract answers from various people according to their views get one to think more and more. Their personal experiences help many readers.,positive
Quora is a great platform and the mobile app makes it easy to view answers. One problem are the links. All the links contain an enormous amount of ads. This isn't a problem with quora just the content in the links. A way to fix this would be to allow us to easily open the links in our browser of choice. The in app browser isn't the greatest thing in the world.,negative

"So there is a web interface, but instead they prompt me to download the app. The prompt is permanent so I have to stop reading,or reload the page and hope for the best. All of that to force me to use the app that I uninstalled because of numerous bugs such as , random sign outs or inability to fetch the content. How about I stop using your service instead? I think I like this idea much more.",negative

"I have no problem with this app whatsoever. The only thing I have qualms with is the fact that the font sometimes isn't very visible, so I suggest giving users the option to control the size of the font so reading can be easier for them and having different fonts to choose from, as the current font could be hard for some users with visual impairments to read. Lastly, I recommend the option of choosing a background color for the whole app that ranges from white, beige, gray and black.",neutral

"Trying to type answers with a physical keyboard causes various issues. Sometimes it steadily takes longer for the characters to echo in the window, suggesting a memory leak. In a couple cases, the on-screen keyboard kept popping up after every keystroke. Also, I occasionally get repeated pop-up notices that the System UI has segfaulted. I don't know exactly what's wrong, but I do know I don't have these issues with any other app.",negative
There is always something interesting to read about. a lot of contributors really make huge efforts to give good answers,positive
Content is great but doesn't let you see the post after a certain period of time on the browser till you download their app! sucks then!,negative
Quote is very helpful. Most questions have already been answered by the public. Some answers and feedback are earnest and informative.,positive
Worst simply worst!!!! How in the hell can you force me to download the app when i am opening quora in chrome browser. You sometimes leave it and some days later this is activated again and is one of the most paramount reason for me to leave this app and platform.,negative
Great app. But needs fast internet because of which I cannot read the content in the places of bad connectivity. I request quora team to make it lighter so that it will open in the low connectivity areas too. Thank you.,positive
"It is buggy due to many server crashes and slowdowns. The Q&A platform itself is addictive; however, technical support is poor or nonexistent thus users are dependent on each other for help. If you like sharing and learning about your interest (400k topics) with 300m users, it is fun and interesting. Threads are individual question pages --anyone can answer. You can have blogs and private groups (""subredditt""). You can block, mute, & report users; customize your feed.",negative
"One of the best app as compared to other social media apps. One can get answer for several questions, give answers to the questions you are eligible to answer. Also, you can write your heart out here and no one will judge you.",positive
"Website forces you into the app in mobile and wont let you continue on the browser after reading few posts even if you are a registered member. I might give the app a try if they werent using such aggressive promoting tactics, but I don't like that the app is forced down my throat when the browser counterpart already has ads, asking for more is greedy. I should be able to use either of them.",negative
"Search is not working most of the time, it tries to load but it doesn't. There is no feature to zoom images.",negative
"Quora is a very interesting site with thousands of real life topics discussed daily, and depending on your interests, you can find a lot of articles to read. The only reason I would downgrade it is that it makes me spend a lot of time reading articles after articles with time that I don't have because the articles are so interesting, it becomes addictive.",positive
No issues lately. Not really distracting (beware of the topics that you follow). But it can take away your time if you don't keep an eye üëÅ‚Äçüó® on this. I personally use this for motivation for my studies. A great community. Regards!,positive
"Was harassed to download the app; then pestered to rate it. Trying to read last night was again interupted with rating request so deleted the app. Never understood what the app actually does other than generate notifications. The biggest problem is that I can barely read it. The text on my Gmail and browser is larger and bolder than the text in the app. The APP significantly degrades my experience with Quora. My rating is for the APP, not Q itself as are most ratings here. ....",negative

"forced to use the app as the website continually has a pop up that prompts me to use it, and wont let me close it.",negative
"Only downloaded this because I was forced to in order to finish reading a post. Every time I was half way through reading the post I was blocked by a full screen add to download the app. So since this app is being forced on me in order to continue reading, you're getting 1 star and uninstalled as soon as I finished reading. There's really no reason that when the post comes to my email that I shouldn't be allowed to finish reading it there.",negative
very useful app for all types of people and makes non learning person be addictive to learning,positive
I love this site as well as the app! I really like how organized it is with all the categories.,positive

"Should include dark mode like most other popular apps now a days. Also, it's pretty annoying to go back and forth from home page to answer and then again from answer to home page. Reading experience should be seemless and effortless.",negative
"The mobile-website now forces to use this app by stopping your reading after a while and fronting you with a popup with two options, both of which will cause you to lose the topic that you were reading. Very irritating.",negative

"Simply, I've become addicted to Quora, and I only found the web-site by accident when I asked Google the word for a 20 line poem I was writing! Now, I've installed the Quora app as well. I get a bit muddled with all the questions and answers sometimes, but really enjoy the mental stimulation, and contact with so many caring, intelligent, educated, and sometimes outrageously amusing people. I like the way it's possible to interact with people who've had similar experiences.",positive
Great App...to get specific answers but sometimes it is annoying....your answer to a question hides in to an another generic question. Than they say quora moderation ...bla bla,negative
"after the recent updates the app freezes quite a lot , i have to restart it several times just to make it work.",negative
i love it. if you read on it enough you can hone what articles you see like a music playlist,positive
Quora gives a platform to air one's views on a variety of issues.One can have a healthy exposure .Quora is open -ended and hence it does not leave you in a dark alley.There is an immense possibility to improve one's writing skill.,positive
There should be a FEATURE TO SEARCH through the list of bookmarks or saved data... It's almost impossible both in the app & the web version to find one particular thing once the data becomes considerably big...,negative
"The earlier versions were awesome. However the past few releases are buggy. The page was not refreshing, answers were not expanding. When I reinstalled, can't login.",negative
it's dumb and stupid and hard to decide which stories are actually worth the time to read all the way to the end or just save yourself the disapointment move on to the next stupid question,negative
Good app for avid readers and we can share many new things which are happening in the world,positive
Defining quora is not possible in words. It provides a great aura of knowledge on one hand. On another it provides better use of time by reading interesting facts stories etc. I didn't find anything as good as quora,positive
"Good app I used evryday for over a year. RECENT BUG, after receiving a notification of upvote or comment etc, i can't click on that user's name to see their profile. This is also happening on the web version so its not only the app's problem. Please fix it otherwise its a huge turn off, we need to directly see the profile of whoever commented or upvoted our content",negative

"I love Quora so a 5üå†rating seemed like the obvious choice, but no app is perfect and can always be improved, right? My search for constructive criticism was anything but easy, which says a lot about how well the app is designed.

It is best and one of the most useful application. Here you can ask any question and get answers from most appropriate people. You can also give answers of some of the questions that have asked to you. By upvoting and by giving suggestions you can make the answers more useful.,positive
"The editor in this app is extremely frustrating as the instant you backtrack to correct something, it inserts prior wording that completely scrambles the edit attempt; more complicated than it needs to be. As a writer, this becomes a SERIOUS HEADACHE, because it's editor inserts things you did not do. The moderators and their ""policies"" are NOT evenly applied to the content. There's a clear bias they think elevates the content, but it doesn't. I deleted the package & strongly advise against it",negative
"The night mode is a must. Don't have option to zoom. Ads and ads and ads. Edit-2 How come a reading app doesn't have a night mode in this era. Guys, bring it or don't force us on websites to download your app.",negative

"Thoguh quora is useful for knowledge gain but the way app is developed is at worst level,app consumes too much battery even though it is not having graphics or high resource consuming content.Update the app ,take customer feedback and incorporate it.My point seems weired but it is worst than any gaming app in terms of resource consumption of device.",negative

"Low rating because of being forced to download an app without being able to finish reading three articles in a row. Get rid of the goddammed pop up and allow people to browse freely, I'm sure they will willingly download your app if you stick the add on sidebars instead of using it to block the whole freaking page!!",negative
The app is good and bad. After a while it chokes on itself! It stops working! I have had to delete it and install it again several times!,negative
Quora is one my favorite platforms to spend my time productively. But this app hangs a lot and ruins the fun of reading a lot of time,negative
"Interesting but a little too much, for me. It reminds me of a friend who is proud of being multi-tasking and he is all over the place and, at the same time, nowhere. But I like you, Quora; just give me some more time to absorb all the bombardment b4 I can make a more responsible comment.",neutral
"Quora is a great place to get answers to philosophical or simple curiosity questions. Lots of different people with various backgrounds, who all wish to ask and answer the questions you might have. It's great.",positive
This is pretty much the most perfect and most useful app to me on my phone though I still think it's need to have a way we can somehow switch to night mode so everything can look crisper on the amoled screen and it will also save a lot more battery than the white background but nonetheless It's so smooth with nice ui.

Since then I've been receiving emails that are similar to the question I answered.

I will update after using it for a while to see if it's worth installing.",neutral
Up to date true information through the horse's mouth.. I mean it's awesome to get real information from each professional.,positive
very useful I would suggest to use an efficient AI to improve alot. So that the users get more feed related to them,positive
The way they advertise is OUTRAGEOUS. I don't go on often but like to go on.

particularly bias answers rather than informative. Be wary when asking questions. Why did they provide such a bias response? Is it from their experience or the experience of someone else?

Exceedingly interesting form of social media. Well worth the time it takes to learn it.,positive
I downloaded the app only to rate it one star for forcing me to download it to read content on your site anymore. People don't want to have to download an app for every single website they visit. I will be uninstalling it immediately and won't be using your app,negative
it's very good to have an app that somehow get you informed and life stories shared to view such and with your own personal experiences makes it so much okay to know you are not alone.,positive

It is very useful to me because I'm a really curious person and always have many doubts and questions in my head but if I search about it I either waste too much of time or else I would be confused because of varied answers..

I have NEVER done this before: upload to rate & dump app after.",negative
the Quora app for Android is very balky when I try to change the page I get a notification that I've been disconnected from the internet or that it's an issue of the server stream. When I post an answer it takes several minutes to get acknowledged that it's done. The app is not reliable!,negative
It is a good forum for all kinds of discussion. I had many of my questions answered satisfactorily. You can connect with people globally that too experts in their fields. Luv it!,positive

"why do I absolutely have to use your stupid app? I want to access the site using the browser, but it is not letting me - tells me to use the app. I hate the app, it is slow on my phone and not adapted to my style of use.",negative
fine. i downloaded it. because i couldn't access your websitw for more than 15 seconds without it pushing the stupid app on me. its sad and pathetic that you have to do it this way,negative
In desperate need of help on a question I have but the app will not allow me to upload a photo which is needed to get a correct accurate answer! major disappointment.,negative
I am facing a problem. My bottom navigation bar in app has disappeared. I am not able to figure out why. Please help. I also tried to reinstall the app but no use.,negative
"I love what the app offers, a great array of topics discussed by everyday people.",positive
I loved it before because it really provided some good insights and information. But now it keeps showing me these political answers and all this political drama. I tried ignoring it for some time but quora is just no more the same place as it was before. Please bring quora back and not let this politics ruin this wonderful platform.,negative
"Ok . I like to see what others are thinking and saying occasionally. A decent enough site, but it leans to the liberal/leftist side a bit too much for my tastes on the political side.",neutral
it's a best platform to learn and ask any type of qus.... and gained knowledge in different way as well as real. life experiences,positive
Great response for my complaint. One more suggestion/request : Please don't show spam and irrelevant links in my feed.,positive
There is so much useful information on Quota! I've leaned so much about narsissists. It makes so much more sense now.,positive
"Fantastic place to share knowledge. Good job !! Sadly, in the content review sent by email the redirection to the app is broken. I get redirected, but to the home page. This is sad, because you tease me with interesting content that I cannot read. Please fix this! :)",positive
"Used to be informative, useful and fun. Now, it is just an excuse for an advertisement. There are 3 advertisements for one question. I understand that advertising is necessary to generate revenue, but there has to be a limit. It has reached a point where it is extremely irritating. Also, forcing me to download the app even before I can read one complete answer is utterly rubbish. This won't give you more downloads, but it would definitely make users leave. Like me. I am never using it again.",negative
"An excellent app! Very informative! A massive thank you to the app designers and a big thank you to everyone using this app, for their time in answering (in great detail and length) some of the worlds most curious and important questions!

This is a very good app and a motivating social media also... which can be helpful for you and an alternative for facebook anf mentor...,positive

quora is the new place to waste my time now...instead of facebook or google news. The que are amazing so are the answers but but.. the app sucks... it reloads in the middle of an answer and i have to scroll down to find that answer... often not finding that que anymore. The app itself crashes after 20 mins or so... it says quora has stopped unfortunately. plz do something to fix theese issues as most of the reviews i read are having the same issues. thank you,negative
"Recent update ruined this app. Navigation is non-existent now. I used to be able to switch easily between Feed, Answer, Notifications, Profile, etc. And it used to be so easy to switch languages. Now it's impossible to switch languages and I can't find anything except my feed.",negative
quora tries to force you to download the app blocks the content on the browser this usually happens when im reading something interesting I give up. no more quora for me,negative
"i don't recall how i found Quora, but so far it is interesting and fun. i enjoy science, and like to communicate with and ""spar"" with people of the same mind. i didn't say sane. i would like to share my sensitive media, etc. with any who enjoy that type of fun.",positive
The app gives you a platform for getting answers for your queries on several topics. Its very helpful but it shouldn't be used in a wrong way...,positive
i have some issue with app is that is does not allow to see history of last post and the second problem is when ever i switch some different app after returning to quora it will refresh the whole content and my last view or unread content gone for ever.so my request to the developer of this app is you can add the said feature in future.,negative
"super app to share ur views,ideas,knowledge.i loved it.it will make you know about new things.one of the best feature no adds n u can ask any question easily.",positive
"Why did this app go from best to worst? To load the homepage it's taking literally hours, the feeback is slow, the touch response isn't working like i am trying to click a question and nothings happening. So uninstalled it and i am using it back on the website",negative
best app to gain information. There is no other app like this. explanations are given by real professionals and in full detail. Best app to gain knowledge in any field..whatever you want to know is here...‚ù§ loved this app very much.,positive
"I Love reading all the general forums. It helps open my mind to all the different opinions people have regarding certain civil and just questions. Very intuitive and informational app. I would recommend this app to everybody! Thanks, -Isaac",positive
The way Quora is forcing people to download their app is very annoying. The big popup for downloading the app doesn't let anyone read the content unless you download the app.,negative
"The partnership program should have been the other way around, pay them for answering, not asking. You get a bunch of dumb questions, not related to the topics of discussion from people looking for a quick and easy buck. I uninstalled today, after reading my emails. It's gotten to a point where I say "" You can't be serious"". If others are really looking for help or advice, the majority of the community has spoiled this though the partnership program.",negative
"I like that professionals give advice freely, and enjoy some of the not so professional answers. Its interesting and l could read them all day.",positive
"hate that you guys are forced me to download app...by poping download app option, which cannot be ignored!!!or get rid of! by blocking further reading!",negative
it's an outstanding application for getting productive knowledge. It provides q platform where anyone can shere ones ideas and experiences. I just suggest others to download it and use on daily bases.,positive
I enjoy reading people's responses to questions. It allows me to see other possibilities I may never have thought of. Keeps my mind open.,positive
It's a good app but... they make you use your full name. I just don't feel comfortable using my full name online but I can't do much else. I don't wanna uninstall the app but I don't like the full name thing. If you are fine with it 5 stars great app.,negative
why do you people want us to download this useless app. let me tell you this that viewing and reading experience on browser is better than your useless app. either make the app version lively or i uninstall it.,negative
"It is best app for knowledge and is very favourable for the people which are fond of interesting and exciting things..,.",positive
This app helped me improve my communication skills... Good for budding writers...,positive
"low review because it forced me to open the article in the app while i was reading that,it compells people to use their latest version when older version can do",neutral
i don't like rhe new UI. Can we please go back to the previous UI. otherwise it's a great app. but the new UI is no good.,negative
stop forcing me to download this app. if I got another pop up for downloading the app then I am done with this whole qoura thing too. also it is also not that much useful for being addictive.,negative
Some great answers. But mostly very childish questions from school kids. Need an update to allow bookmark answers be sorted into categories. Very difficult to find those good answers you previously bookmarked,negative
"wonderfully educative. I enjoy the top rate opinions, detailed clear explanations on most subjects and the wide array of issues covered. pls keep up the excellence! Thank you.",positive
"I just began my Quora conversations. I am not active in my community, in fact I rarely leave my home. so the interaction between people, the sharing of ideas, seems very promising. I'm not sure I'm even 'getting' the whole premise of what's its all about. But I am new. I need to spend more time on site, payiny closer attention to the who's and whys. I have never been involved with an app like this.",positive
"I don't know how I came to be here, but I love it I started by laughing at all the ludicrous questions and then started to see the good ones, which could teach me things. It also gave me an outlet for my anger. ( I am disabled and live alone). Eventually, I realized I could contribute, sometimes with a bit of information to help the OP and sometimes quite sarcastically to those who thought they were experts. I don't 'live' on Quora like some, and often can't for health reasons.",positive
"i love Quora, but i'm unable to use the app if i am on Wifi, whenever i open the app whilr using Wifi i am greeted with a message that says ERROR and i cant get it to work. Help?",negative
"Super obnoxious that you're forced to download the app. Most sites let you close out of the banner at least.Not surprised as quora is incredibly clunky (i want to read the question, explanation and all answers as i scroll, not have to click to expand anything) but way to be a jerk.",negative
"If I search anything at Google, Quora comes at first and highlights to download the app. I downloaded but it was such a useless app. Silly and irrelevant questions were asked. I got pissed off in a day only and uninstalled .",negative
Positive and cathartic...most informative with much truth. A nice guide and support.,positive

"Fun, Recognition for an answer on asking Questions in a Question app,its right at the Start, humbling, Thanks Quora, one thing would be great if i could get my answers and questions from last year otherwise I'm back to help the people because it makes my Day to answer as a 46 yr old Christian many Questions because being an introvert with an above the majority IQ finding something fun i enjoy doing whilst I'm not SLEEPING Or Daydreaming.",positive

low Rating becouse of app not work properly . i faced lags many time in my content tab stats tab and others tabs please resolve these lags .,negative
"Very good app to know people's opinion on certain things and share our own knowledge. Why bookmark option has been hidden in new update? It's hidden or I can't see, can you guys share the idea how to look for bookmarks. In web app I can see it easily, in mobile app also it was easy to see earlier but in new update I can't see it. Guide me the way please. thanks!",neutral
"I don't like the way i was forced to download this app due to the pop up which comes up every 2 minutes on the website. It's so disturbing. Nevertheless, it has amazing features.. But I'm giving a four star",negative
Very informative & educational! Its nice to learn from others people's experiences too.,positive
I really loved this app.It is really good to get information about our topic from the person who have deep knowledge about that subject.I can say it is more easier than google to get information.üëç,positive
sucks as i was in the misdle of reading something and then forced to download the app and then could not find thr rest of what i was reading so i dont have a clue how it ends so i ended you and erased the app,negative
"I was a big fan of this app until this morning when I saw that in images folder inside cache folder which was in com.quora.android folder (basically app's personal space in device), quora had copies few(around 100+) of my personal images from galary and since they are now residing in app's personal space, they can be easily uploaded to quora server and thus can contribute to heavy privacy breach. Reducing 4 starts from the rating for this big fraud.",neutral
"It's a good useful tool to know the unknown questions.Recently only i came to know about this app through email promo advertisement, so then on im using it in a frequent manner.",positive
Why have you given that update in which I have to open each and every link in E-mail and also in bookmarks there are lots of article which I've not bookmarked.,negative
I only downloaded to rate it one star. You can't force people to download the app when they can browse the website perfectly fine. Get rid of the annoying pop-up.,negative
"Quora is a very good, interactive app. You can ask anything here and get expert advice. You also get to read engrossing experiences of other people, some serious, some comic, some sad ,but always riveting. Good job Quora!",positive
ita a good platform gir exchanging ideas. But i don't know why some answers are blocked and much more bad one's allowes to remain,negative
its good social app with very good people . you can find almost every type of people and take suggestion or their thoughts on topics. i love this appüíôüëç,positive
The written material is quite interesting and well to read but a lot of loading has been done which really downs the eagerness to read. Still the variety of questions and their answers always tempt.,positive
"I miss the days when folks on the internet would just talk. Such a great app, you can learn so much and there are people from all professionals and backgrounds. Google does answer most questions, but Quora is an actually person telling you their story to help you be better for you. such an educational site, it's like reading pages in Pandora's Box.",positive
"I love reading community stories and experiences while I'm on the bus, keeping to myself. Every thread I read changes my perspective on life big and small. I LOVE QUORA",positive
It is very interesting and informative. It has a lot of important information that one can retrieve and receive!,positive
"Yeah... it's a very good app,we'll get to know many answers to the questions,we can learn many things,people share their experiences, knowledge what not...many...its a good thing to spend some time with quora..",positive
the app is great but what's really missing out is the dark mode . please bring dark mode to this,positive
Perfect one.. Fun with knowledge. And the story telling is just awesome.. üòä Loved it.. Its my frnd now... Whenever i feel bored i just open it.. Instead now a days i make some time to come n visit the quora app,positive

"App is quite easy to operate but my review here is specifically for quora. Quora as a medium, is very strong platform for sharing your opinion and thoughts but their moderation always seems to be in torpid state while taking logical decisions.",neutral
made me download app to read an article that was emailed to me.  i dont want anymore apps i barely ever use on my phone.  you have a perfectly good website LET US USE IT IF WE WANT TOO!!!!!!!!,negative
I would appreciate more if qoura start giving rewards to its contributors. overall a very good medium to convey yours thing and gain knowledge.,positive
Severe battery drain even when in the background. Drain is so bad that phone loses power even if plugged in. Uninstalling,negative
Good One of the app in my phone. im very much happy while using. Most of the answers which i liked added in the bookmarks tab. And i started writing the answers now,positive
This app is really useless.It couldn't solve the complex problems.It could only solve the simple problems,negative
app is poorly optimized....it takes ages to load images even with a fast internet connection...very annoying..,negative
3 üåü cause server problems occuring continuously otherwise an excellent app. Please try to resolve it.,negative
Please add option of history also in it. Also add a option of posts or answers we have upvotrd so that we can see them when required in future.,neutral
"It do not work properly many time it do not open answers. But app is awsome. if you give dark mode option, it good for us.",negative
"Like many other reviews I just read, the pop-up requiring download of the app sealed the deal for me with Quora. It pissed me off so badly that now I'm going to fight back in any little way I can, such as a negative review, spamming Quora anything, and giving bad word-of-mouth. I only downloaded it to give a negative review, then will uninstall and block all emails, etc from now on. Maybe you developers will learn that ppl don't like being annoyingly forced to submit to unwanted pop-ups and ads!!",negative
"- not intuitive gui: something as simple as ""where they put the menu?"" was not so obvious - too many anecdotal questions and answers (ex. what was your worst xyz?) that remind of yahoo answers - it forces to install the app and use it even when it is more convenient to browse from the website - you can't even save an image or text for personal use, because the copy-paste feature is disabled. - mail spam - many answers and images are copy-pasted from other sources that are not linked nor cited.",negative
"I like the concept. However, it is not easy to use. I just typed a question to ask and never received a notification that it wasn't being posted because they thought the sentence construction was not quite right. If I'm not notified how do I know to go back in to try to fix it? I still can't tell if after changing if it has now posted. Also don't like that I cannot change the people I select you respond if I see someone else who may be better suited to answer. Why can't I change?",negative
Have installed this app in various versions. None of them go beyond the first blank screen even after minutes.,negative
low rating because i was forced to download the app without being able to complete reading the article everytime.,negative
Very much helpful app .... but admin should look for default checking of the answers so as to increase the confidence of the reader....,positive
"Giving it 1 star strictly because I was forced to download the app. I prefer to use mobile website but Quora felt the need to spam a very annoying screenfilling ad, requesting me to download their app, and making it impossible to read the website wihout it. Because of this, they are getting 1 star, and I would give 0 if I could.",negative
the link from the browser w.r.t a specific question is not redirecting to the application. so i cant read the answer from browser as well as in app.,negative
It was good before . But not working well now . i don't know where is the problem . But the app doesn't start it shows - error chunk in coding . plz resolve this issue.,negative
"for one, the whole ""you need to add an interest topic in order to continue"" thing is a huge turnoff for me. I have no interest in any topic it gave me a choice to choose and only wanted it for miscellaneous stories and searches. Anything that forces things like this is an instant ""I will never use this again"" for me since I'm ot about to recieve emails all the time about stuff I couldn't care less about.",negative
I like it once I deactivated practically all the notification settings. Designers of the app: please don't activate ALL notifications by default. :),positive
"Excellent content! Very addictive! Organized well. Overall, a fun and helpful app. 5 stars!!!",positive
After last update app is frustratingly slowed dow. It doesn't open choosen answer straight away. It takes 3 clicks and lot of wasted time for one simple action.,negative
This app is great and helpful. You will get lot of answers for your question from the professionals. It will helpful for outside knowledge.,positive
Its the best app to know people's thinking and mindset without even talking them in reality. Wonderful app i am loving it.üòäüëç,positive
"Very useful,educational and entertaining app for every age groupüòÑ",positive
"Forced to download app, that wasn't enough then they forced to update new version app every time. I don't seek answers directly from quora, I'm directed here from Google. I don't have enough space for the task which can be easily done with website that you already have. This app is just for advertisement, which no one can or should tolerate. Promoting yourself is justified, many will happily download your app but for god sake do not force unnecessary things.",negative

"Quora forced me to download this app. It would not let me use in mobile browser. Pop up "" there is more in app"". Ridiculous trick. Website is better than app. Stop forcing people..........",negative
"Forcing people to download this app through non-exitable, frequent pop-ups on the mobile-web version of Quora is an extremely irritating and selfish act. The big-headed people behind Quora should understand that many people use Quora on their mobile browsers for numerous reasons, e.g. - Faster loading, can switch between multiple questions by switching tabs, saves space on phone and etc. Just admit that you morons are trying to hamper our privacy through your app. Be more clever next time.",negative
"I just had to download this app just to use the site! After finally making an account because the site is completely unuseable without one due to pop-ups you can't click out of, now the un-closeable pop-up is download the app!

"Quora is best app to gain knowledge at any subject at any level.As far as me is concern I got lot of information from experts which are very valuable.I really love this app.Giving only two stars because they people blocked my participation ,due to name policy reasons,even i try to solve with them they are not alowing or listening my request.i am very much disgust.sorry tosay that.",positive
"So-so. Multiple bugs and ""bad gateway"" messages. I've lost two large drafts because the app crashed. Uninstalling, as it's more reliable to use the mobile website directly. Keeping in mind this is a review of the *app*, not the website and its content. The app is sub-par. As mentioned, you're better off using the website via your phone's internet browser, if you want reactivity and to avoid losing your responses.",negative
"Good form of educational entertainment, but I absolutely hate the app for refreshing so often. Sometimes I just want to scroll down my feed and load the questions while reading the most interesting ones and eventually going back to the other ones, but turning off the screen even with the app still running in the background causes it to refresh the feed. This wasn't the case some time ago. I detest this update and really wish it be changed.",negative

"When your pop up tries to force me to download your app, I delete your emails. Disgusting design.",negative
almost impossible to open and install. In my opinion it is a huge amount of B.S. it's not like we're trying to open a bank account. It's just a social media process .... come on!,negative

"WOW REALLY QUORA!?? I have set up my phone in ENGLISH, (US), guess why!? Because I don't understand the Scandinavian languages although I live here temporarily!!

"I recently updated my quora app for two of my android devices. I noticed that the app seems to restart/refresh each time the app is minimized. I updated it on my old device just to be sure that the problem was not from my phone. I hope that this kink is unintended, as it reduces the user's ability to multitask. I want to be able to leave an article halfway to attend to pressing business elsewhere on the device and return to pick up where I left off, and I imagine a lot of people do too.",neutral
why is it so difficult to find the saved bookmarks menu? still looking for it...,negative
After update I can't copy text anymore from the pages. Due to which I can't translate words or sentences simultaneously for improved understanding of the answer or question. This is very troublesome. If the developers fix this then I can change my review.,negative

love it!!! helps me rationalize and analyze my feelings & choices & allows me to recieve other people's outlooks expanding my knowledge & understanding . if I'm feeling uneasy about something I can ask on quora and recieve many responses quickly. every response I've gotten has been AWESOME & has impacted my life & helped me to gain insights I wouldn't have any other way. one of my absolute favorite apps ((; up there next to whisper;)),positive
"The pros:- Quora is better than anything out there. It has it all, advice, entertainment, infotainment, news, reviews. It's a heaven for anyone who likes to read. The Cons :- It's too damned addictive. And the web version is better than the app (due to many reasons, the most important being the ability to open multiple answers simultaneously in multiple tabs) but forces you to download the app the best thing about which is that you get notifs and a slightly cooler ui. But it's the best anyway",positive
"kindly stop forcing customers to download the app.Whenever I go to quora website in my mobile, I cant scroll down after a few scrolls. There was a time I loved quora too much that I spent most of time and I had to uninstall this.I request to solve this bug off.",negative

"Just trying to read an article online. The stupid popup keeps coming up telling me to download the app. I don't want the app, I hate using it. Why does Quora hate browser users? If you want more people using your service you should maximize the different ways to use it, not narrowly force everyone to do it via the app.",negative

Overall I enjoy the site more than the app. Also making a lite version of the app would be a good idea, considering the fact that everyone is making it.",positive
"great, the quora site is basicly an ad for the app now, not everyone wants an app!!, can't even just look at the regular site, thumbs down üëé",negative
people listen to me this is definitely going to make your life's üíØ% better if you hate pop ups and ads as much as i do trust me when i say this download the app called adguard best thing i ever download it has blocked over 36k some ads and i often forget its even running. just install it set it up and your done. you are all welcome to surf the net freely now please enjoy.,positive
I have learned so much about the world from this app. Different people from different places share their knowledge about various subjects. I having encountered any bugs in this app. Worthy of 5 star rating!,positive
One of the best social platform. i always get great information and better insight.,positive
"This app is infuriating, as everytime I am halfway through reading an article, the app decides to refresh the page and I lose the article I was busy reading. Unusable in it's current state. I also take issue with the fact that I was essentially forced to download this app by the website, which prior to the introduction of the intrusive ""Download our app now!"" ad, was the perfect platform for Quora.",negative
"really slow and keeps crashing. the only reason I use it is that I kept getting interrupted with ""install the app"" messages that I couldn't get rid of.",negative
"Overall I m ok with the platform but I truly hate the part when I open Quora on browser and was forced to leave the page I was reading just to drive me to the app. Please give the user what they want, not all user was fond of using app on mobile and rather use browser and I was one of them. I will give 5 star when you remove that disgusting feature.",negative
I just download this app to rate 1 star. I hate it when it force me to download the app and didn't let me read anything in the website :))) I'm gonna rate 1 star and delete this app right now :)))) Have fun :))),negative
I am able to find intelligent answers to any inquiry that I have. Getting input from qualified people is very helpful. Thanks Quora users!!,positive
I have got addicted to this app. It's very helpful app but only thing that I don't like in this app is that once you have written an answer you can't totally delete it and rewrite a new one. What you can do at most is to edit the answer. So please quora team add a new feature in which we can delete our older answer and write a new one.,negative
dark mode pls? and digest is not in it's best form. I think placing it as tab will make it better.,negative
"I only downloaded the app to give 1star coz these morons think it is ok to force users to download the app by those irritating popups. Had enough of this nonsence, I was forced to regester which was acceptable sort of, but now this! This is the end of quora for me. I know loosing a user won't mean much to them, but I wish more people become aware of their forcing mentality and stop tolerating this behaviour or all the sites will force users to use their apps to mine more data out of their users.",negative
"Pretty good app. It would be great to have a dark mode in the app too, I hope it's coming soon :)",positive
Best platform to share and collect knowledge from the folks all around the world from their real life experiences.. Awesome app. very useful and informative too.,positive
"A very useful app linked to this global q+a resource, the usual complement of idiot trolls asking the same questions every few days, though they can be voted down, which is nice.",positive
"Trust me, you wont regret spending time on Quora rather than wasting it on Facebook, Instagram, etc. It's an app that you must install without wasting any time.",positive
"lately i've been roaming around trying to improve my life, looking for the best social media for it. and yup qoura got it, it has so many inspiring writers around the world, and its so well written. i'm not a fan of reading or even reviewing some app but this got me, so 5 stars for you.",positive
"I got the app simply to leave a review, and will be deleting it promptly after. The ridiculous unclosable pop up on the website gives you two options- download the quora app or I already have the app. Apparently it doesn't matter which option I choose as both links take me to Google play to download their stupid app that I dont want. Here's the best part... the app isn't compatible with my device! I ignored that and downloaded it anyway to leave this review, but the install won't complete.",negative
Fun and typically helpful. Not a perfect UI.,positive
Best medium to evolve oneself with the help of other people's experience. N one stop for all your questions about anything.,positive
Best app to get knowledge from people who are already into it. I myself can write answers for my juniors or the ones that need it. Best part is that one can get well popularity without even bothering about someone defaming.,positive
Its not just a practical app. Its a FUN app. I love reading the random answer to random questions random people have. The app works really well.,positive
Don't want the app. I want to read in my browser. Don't force me to have it. Leave me alone. Dicks. Update 6th June 2019...I need to lower score to half a star or even a negative star. Quora are doing it again....not letting me view content in browser. I don't want app. it takes up much needed space on my phone.,negative
"Great all in all, but a dark mode/theme mode would be cool, like how Reddit has themes.",positive
"The app is fine but I do not want it on my phone, and chrome does not let me on the site, it just asks if I have the app and does not let me opt out of downloading it. if that gets fixed I'll give 5 stars",negative
It's one of the best apps on my phone right now. I get info about random facts I love to read at any point in time. Am not addicted but can't see myself stopping.,positive
"stop trying to make me install your app! i just want to read the web version, but then a stupid un-closeable popup appears forcing me to install your app.",negative
"A very great app, really changed my life but there is something missing. Yup, it's dark mode",negative
This is a really enjoyable app. So many different people with different types of thinking and answering so many different types of questions. I like it.,positive
"The app is getting refreshed for no reason. I have 6gb ram poco f1 phone and if I just minimize and open the app again, it just restarts and i dont have any other app open except quora. Please optimize the app properly. Its a shame if this happens on a 6gb ram android phone with all the bells and whistles.",negative
"very useful app, almost all the my quries solved here very authentically, logically and reliably, I am very much thankful to Quora.",positive
"Found this by accident. Not sure how it discovered the subjects I'm interested in, but glad it did. Find myself reading it more often than I should. Would recommend.",positive
"Great app, gives you wide variety of knowledge of various fields and shares experiences, opinions of different people across the world.",positive
I love reading about people and their stories. could pass hours on this app. love it,positive
very good. but please fix the algorithm so my timeline can look less messy. also tone it down will the quora partner will ya? been using this app for two years!,positive
"A good platform for sharing experience and thoughts. but i can not read the answer that i have read several hours or minutes ago, because the app does not store your read history, which i think is very unconvenient . hope to add this history function later.",negative
I felt that this is the best app to express all your experience and let everyone learn from the mistakes that were made. I am very thankful to have this app . This app gives me new motivation and gives me grt ideas about future.,positive
"A very nice concept and executed very well, almost. with the latest update the comments are not loading at all.",positive
very best app to find out any random question answer.....whenever i stuck about even silly question also i always get the answers......very satisfied answer too,positive
"I limit the download of apps onto my phone and generally use my browser for webpage based things like this, but half of the answer i was reading on their perfectly usable and convenient website was held hostage until i downloaded the app. i get it, you spend a fortune on an app and it doesn't quite land, but literally denying service (supported by ads so still revenue) to enforce app downloads is absurd and suspicious",negative
Very useful and informative app. I was able to clear my doubts on multiple issues.,positive
"overall interface is great, but lack of one thing, dark theme.",positive
Zero Star wasnt there to give. Don't force to download ur app while browsing and reading a article interestingly. I hv missed that article now. U forced me to login at browser and now forced me to download. Will uninstall this app soon. Dont worry.,negative
what is the difference between your app and website.. there is no option for history what we have opened recently there is no option to copy text its like simple book..,negative
"you know this app and site is irrelevant when they have to resort to forcing you to download the movile app to read content. also, the relentless emails that ive already unsubscribed to but still land in my inbox anyway? seriously, stop it.",negative
"Since last update every time it shows ""no stories for you"". Very disappointed.",negative
"Everything is awesome , but quora should allow its readers to download images posted in the answers written .",positive
"Spaming reader on internet that should download Android app, too bad! Have downloaded the app months ago but found it not necessary to fill mine phone with it. So therefore removed, not installed and will not install",negative
"No to forced app downloads! Disgusting way to get people to use your mobile apps, I browse websites and read online I do not need companies forcing me to clutter my phone eat my data with their apps that feed information about myself back to the app developers such as location, contacts, and a plethora of other metrics they have no business collecting from any private citizen. I downloaded the app and blocked it via my android app firewall just to write this review. @quora so long and goodbye!",negative
"I have been using Quora since 2018.I personally found it so helpful that it connects me with the people around the globe.My questions are being answered by several experts,students and any more talented people across the world.It gets me updated with the new things.Now I always open Quora when I feel alone.Few things on Quora touches my heart.Love you Quora!",positive
this app is awesome. I'm able to get real answers from real people who seem to have knowledge of the things that are asked it's a fantastic place to learn new things I'd recommend using it to everyone I'm on here daily asking all sorts of questions,positive
the only app where the smoothness and interface is better in website mode compared to app,positive
"After recent update, I am not able to get comments for any answer. Quora app is showing animation and continues to show animation, but doesn't shows comments even after 30 minutes.",negative
I couldn't see the writer info as it is loading all the time at the end of the answer. The comments are also loading for lifetime. Please fix this issue.,negative
"used to be way better. too many repetitive questions being posted. and not ones that have interesting and informative answers. different stories and experiences from peoples lives? yes. for example i see these two questions showing up way too often a) ""whats the best 'you just picked a fight with the wrong person' experience youve had?"" b) ""whats the strangest thing to happen to you in someone else's bed?"" still some good content if you take the time to look though, thats why 3 stars not 2.",negative
"Web page forced me to install app for no good reason... the app is slow, crashes and not substantially different from the website",negative
"It's one of my favorite apps, but sometimes, especially recently, the comments on an answer weren't loading and when I wanted to ask a question recently it wouldn't let me, it says 'adding' forever without my question being asked. Please fix this, as of right now this truly bothers me. Otherwise 5 Stars.",negative
"i found out i am not the first (or the second, or the third, etc.) to download this app just to be able to give one star after being forced to do so. Just want to read thru and against any more shortcut on my screen.",negative
"every day new update is available, and it annoys me as a message is seen update available, How many times you want me to update it, 365 times?",negative
"Forced to download to finish reading an article!!!! Worst APP EVER!!! What kind of company does this. I was very happy with the website. when you hit ""I already have the App"" it takes to to the play store. You can't refresh or read until you download the app. Quora, your app developer has failed you. I hope you get back your investment from this person/business.",negative
poor marketing. try using it on my phone via email and doesn't let me finish reading unless I download the app. that's low. that's like pop up ad low. just plain irritating. was forced to download it to finish. that's like if TV let you watch the first 20 minutes of a movie but then stopped you and didn't let you finish until you rated the production company on their website. then after your done you can watch the movie again except from the beginning.,negative
gives me lots of things to read when I am bored and sometimes people answer my questions. Great for passing time to be honest.,positive
"This app is good in general, but I cant post any questions on it. Whenever I try to ask a question it just keeps loading for a long time.....and its not a network problem as well, as I had a good internet connection.",negative
"It would have gotten 5 stars if the questions that were relevant to my situation ,at the time I ask, got answered. But questions that are just random thought always get answered.",neutral
its been over a day and my answers individually show more than fifty views but the stats are showing only seven. dont know what the problem is...,negative
2 stars because of being forced to download the app without finish reading articles.Quora u need to improve ur visitor experience for sure.,negative
"Don't want it, don't need it. I prefer viewing forums via a webpage. As this appears no longer possible, I will remove myself from quora entirely.",negative
Comments are not opening. Profiles also not working. All this issues started with latest update.,negative
add dark theme to it. i always wanted it & these days it's in trend as well. it saves battery and it's good for reading purpose.,positive
"I am enjoying using Quora, but recently the Android version of the app has stopped allowing me to add questions. After pressing the Add Question button, it just sits there saying ""Adding"" and hangs. It would be great if this major bug could be resolved quickly.",negative
Great app but the on the new update I only get two or three stories on my feed despite following many topics. So I keep on refreshing. please fix this,negative
"I am unsatisfied with the way I was forced to install the app if I wanted to continue reading articles delivered to my email. If I don't want the app, that should be my choice. Unsatisfactory.",negative
It is good. i think it is the best question and answer platform i've ever known. it is very educational from the answer that people sent. It is helps me learn something new everyday. thank you Quora!,positive
Forced to install this stupid app I dont want so i can finish reading an article when I should be able to read it online without taking up space on my phone. This feels like bullying and I will now unsubscribe to Quora content. Lost my attention.,negative
This app is simply phenomenal . This is the platform where you can share your wisdom and gain more on using it.I have already been using it since last year and truely this has been a boon for me.Thanks for creating such a field where even a common man like me can also be famous on the basis of pure knowledge. Thanks again.,positive
Get rid of the popup that forces you to download the app. Some of us are content to read using a browser. This is very irritating.,negative
"the app is superb in the sense for what its made for-reading, sharing knowledge and lessons of life and etc. The app is easy to use and friendly interface. just one issue is that i am not able to open the comments section. it jsut doesnt show. please look into this.",positive
"This is the first smartphone I bought with my own cash. I've been using it for 4 years and apart from the slightly degenerated battery, it should do fine for another year or two. Storage is low but it's only an issue because every website nowadays forces/annoys you to install their bloated app. OK, its only 7MB but it doesn't have any features that my browser does. In fact, it lacks a couple.",positive
1 star because I can't go through one answer before there is a pop up forcing you to download the app. This would make people angry so it's of no use because that pop up does not go away.,negative
White header is bit odd looking. Previous look with red header was great.,neutral
"Dear Quora devs, I would appreciate if I could just read the answers and 
articles without the app interrupting me by asking ""did you find this 
answer useful"" before I ever read the first word... It's obtrusive, 
annoying and unhelpful. Other than that, excellent job.",negative
doesn't work on my s10+. They won't let you use the website (i.e. make you download the app).,negative
App frequently crashes after the latest update. Unable to add questions.Once Add button is clicked it takes ages to process. Please fix that .,negative
"Installed just so I could write a review. I would enjoy being able to read the review without the stupid popup coming up. I have Adblock on my computer so I'll just read them there. Who knows, I might just get rid of my account entirely",negative
I have installed this app just to Rate it one star. Its forcefully keeps recommending to download and there is no cancel button. Even i already download button redirects to play store.,negative
"I don't know what happened, but I am unable to open my account after the recent update. first I thought it was due to bad network but till now I am unable to open my account. I need help, i had recently crossed 50K marks...ü§îü§î",negative
"After the recent update the application is not working as it should , in th home page instead of showing my feed it only ahows my profile. i tried all possible methods to try to chsnge it but it wouldn't budge. Do something about this ASAP..",negative
"Lately( 12-06-2019), comments section in the quora app are not loading at all. so, the experience is going down drastically.",negative
"I was reading something on quotra on browser. halfway through, i get an annoying popup asking me to install this app with no option to close the annoying popup. if I wanted the app, i will choose to install it. you can't just block someone from reading just to force them to install your stupid app. installed just so that i get the option to write review here. uninstalling and deleting my account. you've already had a security breach once, at least be humble and let users decide what they want.",negative
Why are comments not loading!!? why do I have to refresh for them to load? why do the pictures not load quickly at once?,negative
its a great platform to gather ideas and information about a certain question. very user friendly.,positive
"If you have any type of question, download this app. It's organized and put together well, it's usually very detailed and that's what I like about this app.",positive
"I have a problem with Quora. First of all, it's a great app. It's simple and provides me with what I need. But, it keeps crashing and not opening up. In a week I can even go 3 days without being able to access the platform. Since am usually psyched up over Quora Digest too much, it's reached a point where am not interested anymore. I don't know why it always crashes then resets itself later, but I don't like it. And that single problem has made me disinterested almost completely.",negative
Hai I really love and use this app for a verylong time. The only annoying thing is there are a lot of ad links & it will be better if they introduce the dark night theme considering a lot of users will benefit from this.,positive
force to update the app with being able to read the article first..! no app forcefully updates.,neutral
The team that has designed this android quora app is very dumb as it seems. Every now and then they change the location of bookmark icon or button and make it a mystery for others to solve. In my case (ver 2.8.12) its just absent.,negative
there is no shortcut key to view bookmarks. plz do update and add bookmark key which is readily accessable.,neutral
quora is degrading day by day. it was interesting earlier but now it has become so biased. this app doesn't have good content anymore. quoras quality of content is going down . quora moderation policy is bad. freedom of expression is getting lost in quora. by banishing good writers for petty reasons quora is curbing freedom of speech . this app doesn't seem like knowledge sharing one anymore. it is so partial and biased . not worthy of our time,negative
"I absolutely hate when websites get an app then force you to download it or you can't read their story on their damn website. It's annoying and I can't stand it. I downloaded this just so I can read one story that was good, but after that I'm immediately uninstalling this app.",negative
"I am giving 3 stars because a problem I am facing on the app. What I have learned from others is that they are also facing the same problem. When you try to shift from one language mode to another, the screen often becomes blank and returns to the previous page. It happens so often that it's now creating nuisance. I hope Quora will fix this.",negative
it could have been even more better if app has night mode/reading mode option.,positive
it was a good website but it seriously has the worst moderation policies leading to many of the good writers quitting. They dont bother to listen to the people and correct their mistakes at all.,negative
I like this kind of form. I've been able to give some great advice and it seems most people like my answers. I've found some intelligent people this way and am proud of the fact I have a few followers.,positive
"Typical leftist behaviour of MODERATION. If you can't listen truth, You must call your app 'selected questions and selected answers'. QUORA YOU ARE HYPOCRITE LEFTIST MEDIA, JUST LIKE A FEW OTHERS. SHAME ON YOU, uninstalling the app by giving 1 star rating. Librandu.",negative
not able to access bookmarks after the update and why do you force us to download your app on android..you are already earning huge by running ads..shooo from my phone,negative
"joined for one reason, and I'm staying for a completely different one. great app, love the questions and answers.",positive
Dont force readers to download your app..if its good they will download it and if its not they will uninstall after reading the article for which they had downloaded this app.,neutral
"It is an absolutely awesome and mindblowing app. No Doubt. But I am now sometimes facing problems using the app. The ""Discover New People"" & ""New topics for You"" drawer in between news feed is not scrolling horizontally properly and the comment section below answers keeps on loading but does not appear instead of proper internet connectivity. Same happens sometimes with Bio of Writers below answers. I was not facing this problem before but since last second update I am frequently facing this.",positive
"Its an ocean of knowledge if you know how to use it in a proper way, and if you don't then it can lead to your downfall. Overall its an amazing app. Should download it but don't get addicted. I didn't rate it 5 because it has a hell lot of glitches",positive
This app is wonderful for all students. I'm also using this app I learned about many information which I want to learn.,positive
You suck for making me download this app when I didn't want to. I've always just been able to view questions and answers without being forced by a popup to download the app.,negative
"I enjoy this app for the most part. but recently it has been very hit or miss in whether it will allow me to ask a question. I would type my question, no related questions would populate, and then when I click add, the button goes to the ""adding"" state and nothing happens.",negative
"I wanted to give more stars.....but they allowed only 5.......best app I have come across!!! as nothing is perfect in world so it does have a few glitches,apart from that,just smoooooooth!",positive
"Banning great writers just because they don't conform to certain idea is not the best unbiased knowledge-sharing platform. If quota doesn't change its policies respecting people and their credentials, its going to lose a large base of credible audience as well. Time is ticking!",negative
An amazing app. Easy to use. Wide range of topics. And in several languages! The only thing that could make it better would be to have Night mode or Dark mode. Hopefully we'll get it soon!,positive
"Earlier it used to be good. now only useless content, bugs and slow load times",negative
I did not understand the app at first. Now I do and its great. Love it! am having fun teaching and learning. Thank You!,positive
"latest update has ruined it. one answer and 2 advs, that's all i see in my feed. it is soo irritating . fix it.",negative
"Could you please, for the love of Quora, stop forcing me to download this app when I'm using Quora in my mobile browser instead of your app? It is incredibly annoying. Many of the low star app reviews comes from your clearly ineffective policy of enforcing Quora mobile app use and it displeases people when we can't make a choice, so we retaliate. With a passion for vengeance. Put some adds about Quora app on mobile website, or maybe something else, whatever, but NEVER EVER FORCE PEOPLE.",negative
I absolutely love Quora. But the app is horrible. Comments take ten minutes on average to load. Questions are nearly impossible to add through the app. And clicking often interacts with someothing above or below where clicked. I will happily change this to five stars once the app works properly.,negative
"Every single day my curious drives me to Quora and am glad i have found helpful content direct from different experts.I recommend this for the curious ones like me, Knowledge is power!!",positive
"i usually do not give bad reviews over the apps as i am myselfa developer but while considering a user centered design, you do not want a user to feel forced and irritated with pop ups that force you to do something and does not have any option. i downloaded the app just to give the review you needed.",neutral
"I like Quora, it's a nice platform. However, it's got problems, like moderation is very unfair and almost wholly robotic, making for very questionable moderation decisions. I also think the direct messaging system is slow and kinda awkward. But that's just me. Overall, Quora's a great place. There are nuts and fanatics as with anywhere on the internet, but also some great people and fantastic writers. I've made real friends through Quora, I love writing on Quora, and am overall pleased.",negative
"I've rarely seen an app that encourages discussion and debate be so active in interfering with these activities. They employ sneaky tactics and do not inform their users of actions that affect their account- for some reason at this time, I am unable to read comments on all articles and answers on the app. Why? Have no idea...and have had no luck in ""contacting"" them. Sad because it has a lot of potential",negative
I just started learning real things and useful stuff when I started going through quora.Contains a lot of domains and we can select our area of interest..thanks alot quora..,positive
"I only downloaded it so I can give it zero stars...Oh, wait, that's not even possible! I can't believe that there are websites out there that they force you to download their app otherwise you can't browse their page. Are you kidding? I couldn't care about another useless app at the moment to bloat my phone with. Thanks but no thanks Quora, I'm unsubscribing.",negative
"Quora ate 1.8 GB? What type of content you are storing, you don't show any offline data! Please fix that data leak or stale data problem!",negative
App is super .It contains very useful answers.But am giving only one star becoz it takes more time to open the content...fed up with waiting. And it takes more time to load the answer.lots of data consuming..very worst app in service.,negative
It's great app to understand general and personal view on a topic. Helps to make better understaing of the problem.Great platform to share your knowledge to help others.,positive
"If i don't feel like downloading the app, i shouldn't be prevented from viewing the website on my phone because of your full screen popup that can't be exited. Such a jerk move.",negative
"Good app. There was a problem with the previous version that make it no longer able to view the expanded comment. However the dev quickly fix it, and it works well now!",positive
"the app's great for recommendations, interface is bit old but then its super fast and used little data, the apo is easy to use and don't miss answering other doubts as yours are too answered by someone",positive
If you haven't updated your app you won't be able to use it. It displays the message that then forces you to update,negative
Captivating subjects. Fascinating answers. I have fallen back in love with reading again. I cannot say enough about how Quota has brought dimension back to me after a long illness!!!,positive
"This app can not be opened no matter how manys times I'd tried. I am going nuts. I stayed up late last night to get it done,but i failed.",negative
Its a good platform to learn something new everyday. It also helps you get in touch with new people from around the globe and share your thoughts.,positive
cannot ask questions containing more than 250 character!! if the concise question is more than 250 character then how the hell can I make it short and ask!? ridiculous! this needs to changed!,negative
"Always my home page displays ""No stories"". This happens even when I click on an answer link from my email digest. Frustrating!",negative
"very nice app,for learners. you can ask any type of answer in it and get notified when somebody answers it!!",positive
"It a great platform to live while you learn from many people throughout the world, but talking about the app- it's terrible. No dark mode to support night readers, please change the messaging UI similar to messenger, these two updates can win a lot of learning minds and a 5 star from me as well.",negative
"i give this app 5 stars coz its very interesting and informative. Kind of like Wikipedia. Ask any question & get a answer. Any subject from Quantom Physics to How to's, Time travel, The earth, The Universe, Pick ANY subject. Everything, anything, any topic, i absolutely love it. And its very easy to use. Thank you to the Developers of this app üëç",positive
When downloaded it first it used to function greatly but as the upgrades kept coming it became worse everytime. Its always lacking. I click on a answer and it opens another one. And some other problems too. so i am deleteing it,negative
"Quora is a nice platform for finding answers to questions but it is a very slow app. Makers of this app should improvise the speed of this app. It takes too long to refresh. Secondly, the user interface is not very attractive. I request the makers to make the user interface a little more attractive to sustain the attention of the users. Thirdly, there is no 'justify' option for the answers we write. The writeup doesn't look uniform because of this. So this is a good app but needs a lot of changes",negative
"i love this app! if want to learn english and read many interesting articles, this is a very app, u need.",positive
"The UI is decent, but I hate how if I exit the app I cant continue reading the question I left off. If theres a history bar for all the questions read that would be nice.",negative
"I love this app, has a wide variety of topics that I have an interest in. Great for people who love to learn and read a lot.",positive
"it's a very good app. There are opportunities to share ,post, ask queries ,answer known questions etc etc etc . In one word, it's very helpful .üòÉüíéüíé",positive
"quora is the best platform for learning, sharing knowledge etc.we can learn almost any category... corns: Need to improve ui , little confusing ...",positive
extremely unresponsive app and takes years to load content that too on a high speed wifi.,negative
Very biased platform. App gets refreshed everytime after leaving. Random hangups. It was good in older versions.,negative
It is worst. Like everytime I try to ask a question it doesnt publish my question and notification keeps on popping that it needs improvement. Other people have many long questions but they are published but not mine. Sorry to say this app or website is of no use for me,negative
I find this app extremely useful for people especially for adults who are experiencing bad situations.I mean you can find any information and get answers that you ask. overall this app is great!without any doubt!,positive
"more forced down your throat, Anti-social Network, digital noise. lots of Neo-Nazi/Nationalist Drek. it has its occasional uses. its Basically a clearing in the woods for LIKE MINDED, individuals to have some (not so veiled) Torch lit meetings. up vote/down vote. love me and how smart what I just copied and pasted is. IMO . it's like everything else, contaminated.",neutral
forces you to install app when reading in browser. Especially when you are reading a article and then you land on play store.. If you are that persistent to install app.. I quit quora,negative
"Long time user. Was really amazing but the focus has changed from rewarding quality answers to rewarding terrible questions. How that helps ""share the world's knowledge"" I can't tell.",negative
Better than Facebook. Keeps you abreast with the latest information at all times everywhere.,positive
"Gave 5 üåü, Idea and platform is awesome, but your server is very slow, specially when it comes to image loading, (obviously when my internet speed is not so grate, but at same speed I can use Google services such as playstore flawless, loading apps and images which are not saved in catche) so I think you can possibly improve.",positive
"content is respectful and shows both positive and negative opinions. Leaves decision up to you. Informative. Enjoy reading the different viewpoints whether I agree or not. some content is in foreign language, but not as the norm.",positive
"very disappointed I submitted my first -to be- comment, it was totally respectfully written, but they never published it, nor did they explain why, nor have they after me having contacted them twice since my attempt 2 weeks ago.",negative
"I like reading a lot of the stories. a lot of diffrent types good, bad, sad, funny, and what ever cheches my eye.",positive
was very helpful when i was collecting information for Canada Express Entry. A very valuable app and website that contains information difficult to find elsewhere,positive
I down-loaded just so I could give a 1 star and delete it. what sort of f'd up POS company forces you to download an app to visit their website in which the mobile browser is exponentially better? All for $ and control. Sickening. Be ashamed.,negative
"Tried to read an article on the quora website and was forced to install the app against my will. They kept on sending me to the install page. Not acceptable. Edit: I've read literally hundreds of reviews that rate Quora with 1 star due to the forced app install! I've made it my mission to go and upvote all those reviews as being helpful, everyone should spend a few minutes to do this as well! Done in VERY poor taste. Despicable! This developer probably uses fake accounts to keep a high rating",negative
"One of finest platform to get answer from a person you want, whereas there are lot of trash answer from persons don't have any experience or knowledge of particular subject. anyway Quora is one of the few great things happened to world.",positive
"I just want to say for the record, FORCING someone to download an app or they cannot continue reading on a mobile phone is absolutely scummy.",negative
It is great to learn about alot of stuff on variety of topics. Great help in many ways.,positive
when i open quora from browser it makes me compulsion to download the application...you are reading something and when you click on continue reading the browser web page redirects to play store which is annoyingüò§,negative
"Initially i loved this platform, but eventually i came to know how biased quora is, it banned the accounts of prominent writers leaning towards right. Uninstalling it right awayÔºÅ",negative
"Forcing a user to download your unnecessary app just so i can finish what I was reading IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ARTICLE is the UX equivalent of turning off a gas pump in the middle of someone filling up just so they can go inside and use their rewards card - annoying, unnecessary, and incredibly distracting. Feel free to continue doing this if you want to keep shooting yourself in the foot as far as onboarding goes. You know you don't need to do it, and forcing it on users will never be okay.",negative
"Please stop forcing us to download the app.I use quora on Chrome and there are forceful notifications which cover our full screen until we download the app. Edit:Even though i have downloaded the app i sometimes tend to use quora on chrome but still i am forced to link on quora app,and i lose the answer i am reading.",negative
this platform thought me lot of good things but only one disappointing is they put pics which some people battling to come out of it like(intemacy) just to attract to read there quora. must stop this type of activity.,negative
Some automatic features are annoying. VERY annoying for a lot of people using Quora. It has very good potential and it's a very good app yet a lot of the automatic features are just making the experience annoying and very stressful.,negative
it's a good way that makes any questions to ask about it was really a lot to learn the basics and the answers. .,positive
"Excellent app, works great. Beautiful and useful at the same time.",positive
"this app is not working from 3 days for me.. i love quora website is always better than app i feel.. ill probably shift back to website and read, Instead of this application..",positive
"quora is that platform where you can feel and share your thoughts, personal experiences and simultaneously you would learn from other's experiences! Great platform indeed!",positive
"Really good discussions and informative answers and viewpoints, along with a fair share of retorical questions from people trying to press their ideology. The platform does make it easy to ignore the superfluous.",positive
"I like Quora, I get emails and read them just fine subsequently from said email. Until today. I tried reading them from the email like normal and Quora keeps interrupting with, have you downloaded the app? and refuses to let me keep reading on the browser. Dont be like Quora.",negative
"App does not work! Was forced to download the app if I wanted to continue reading answers on the site. (A pop up continually asking if I had the app and would not allow me to progress further on the web) Went back to that question and clicked on the answers to read more. 'Page Not Found' So... the page I was just looking at find on Chrome doesn't exist? Stick to the website Quora. Your app developers aren't there yet. You got that +1 on your download number, At the cost of a daily user.",negative
"While the content is fine, the horrible lag and freeze ups hinder the experience. I love the app, but not the poor qaulity of support. Edit: So the lag and freeze ups are solved, but now the notifications keep refreshing every second, making it impossible to read them.",negative
So much of bugs and spam accounts ruining this site. Moderation has failed to control them. False site.,negative
"I love how easy it is to ask my questions, read answers to my questions, and answer other questions, and especially I enjoy reading other people's answers to other people's questions.",positive
i really like the concept of quora. But the interface sucks. Your answer doesn't pop open even after clicking repetitively. Gateway errors are frequent.,negative
"Quora is the best, but the app isn't. It stops when I try to answer any question. And after that, whenever I open the app the screen starts blinking. Needs to get fixed.",negative
"The Quora app is something that you use because you really have no choice. Their web site will kick you off if you use it from a mobile browser. If you tell the mobile browser to pretend that it's a desktop browser, you can use it for longer, but you miss out on the formatting toolbar when leaving comments. Otherwise the web experience is strictly better. Want to reread an answer while replying to a comment? Nope! The app gets new bugs almost daily, too.",negative
Goodbapp for knowledge but theails are sometimes a bit annoying so something should be done for that only normal notifications should be given although it gives notifications but the mails are annoying they full my inboxüò©üò©üò´üò´üåúüò§üòàüòà,negative
This app is amazing and quite addictive but in a good way since the user gets to know a lot of new things from this platform. However the developers should add a history or library option so that people can revisit the articles they once did.,positive
"This app helped me clear many of my doubts. Be it career related, which tech to buy and many more. You get advice from experienced individual.",positive
So you now will not let me browse your website on my mobile browser?! Why does the website keep forcing me to download this app and close itself everytime I try closing the pop-up?,negative
"Yet another useless app. Nobody would ever download this bloated whale when they could simply use a web browser to access the same comment. Unless, of course, the webpage is blocked on mobile to force you to download another stupid app. I'll be dumping quora entirely after this.",negative
Why do i have to download this app instead of just continuing in Chrome?? I was in the middle of reading a good article n had to download this to continue reading. When i opened the app I lost the article n cant find what i was reading. THIS IS BULLS+IT!!!!!,negative
"Wonderful app. However, an option to organise bookmarks into different folders would be appreciated. Also, it slows down when you use it to access an external site",positive
best app for learning many things...and help in contact the people with experience in our desired field.... great job...thanks to the creater... üëç,positive
"Firstly they forced me to download this app. I mean what it that. Takes too long to load, I was seriously much happier when I used quora on my browser. Also lags too much (Doesn't lags when I use it on chrome).",negative
I want to browse it in chrome without installing the app. But every time a pop up is opening to download this app which can not be closed.,negative
"i fell very lucky , highly informative, and covers all the subject.faithfull .i thank very much to the quora team",positive
"Every month the make pointless changes in the app's interface which don't make it better or worse, it just makes it harder to use it since all the features keep changing place.",negative
Great learning tool for someone who learns best through communicating in groups or social spaces.,positive
"This app answers all my queries and is super addictive. If i am bored i just start the app and hours will fly like a bird. 4 stars because they don't tell what is new in the updates. Also, my data was breached. So now 3 stars.",positive
latest update 2.8.12 is messed up. I am always getting no stories in your feed. Getting notifications and able to answer but feed does not show anything.,negative
data consumption is very very very........ high. even YouTube's data consumption is lesser than quora's..... please fix it,negative
"This is one of the very few apps that make me drain all my phone's battery :)  I just can't get enough of it. This is nothing but lost time, though! It's just so much valuable info here",positive
cant read app permissions or view any details about software agreements. not good will uninstall.,negative
"Saved my sanity. Great questions,great answers from great people from all over the world willing to share their own experiences on all kinds of subjects ranging from food to health to mental illness to family and children. Great advice. There is just not enough i can say about what Quora has done for me. So ill say thank you Quora. i recommend this site and app to everybody!",positive
"I absolutely love Quora, the interactive format is brilliant. No other social media site steals this much of my time. My only complaint is the app itself is glitchy, we'll see if the update helps.",positive
"nice aap. it resolve all my issues and problems. something you want to know just type and people will answer. it is simple, fast and time efficient aap. I use quora for my general knowledge and study. it's cool that's why I am giving 5 stars to quora.",positive
i wish if this app could have widget. it would have been easier to scroll through some interesting stuff.,positive
"Awesome Q & A service whether in the desktop or Android. And unlike the elitist strange services like StackExchange, you don't have to spend months building reputation just to comment or vote. And you can ask any question, not just a narrow range of questions that have a strict 300 page manual with rules for what questions you can ask lol. Highly recommended.",positive
"Want reliable answers about important questions? Then quora is your go to app. only one minor problem: there are a lot of ignorant people using it also, so you have to filter some unwanted answers. 4/5 just because I think quora could block the ignorants from the app but doesn't want to because it generates more clicks.",negative
"It would be very nice to have a datk theme, so, one can easily read for some time in dark.",positive
I'm trying to read articles on the browser and some bastard helicopter pop up keeps stopping me and sending me here to download the app. I don't want the app a holes. I just want to read what it was that I was reading. Infuriating.,negative
Its a good app for readers. however if the developers give an option like Dark theme. it will be easier to read.,positive
Best app for knowledge seekers. One can get second hand experience of our everyday life from this useful app. 4 star given for it's performance and utility. Less 1 star for its app interface.,positive
"I love the app, instant responses, simplistic layout and the best thing of all is that the ads don't bother me because they're related to the content I'm interested in. On top of that, they're never product ads, they advertise articles and blogs which I really appreciate.",positive
very helpful as I am taking an online chemistry course this helps me to very easily ask questions my articles and videos cannot answer.,positive
"I like Quora. Poor spelling is often annoying but at times culturally understandable. Big fingers like mine further touchscreen challenges. I am not clever with computers so would like to know how to return Quora to How It Was; I figure ditching this ill conceived PopUp. Those submitting scathing reviews share my opinion. cheers Fred (Budwig Protocol for b/fast. Cancer ""cure"" that's also your food; then you don't eat much else as it is so filling/ nutritious.)",negative
"used to be amazing. they let it be overrun with advertisers and knowledgeless self promoting ""experts"". App isn't great either. frequently refuses to load pages when they load fine on the website.",negative
the app is best but idk why the app is not functioning well from a day or two......even on 4 GB ram mobile...plzz look into this....as contents of app are not fully displayed on mobile..,negative
"Love the app but it is bugged. After searching and getting your results, sometimes it won't let you click on any of the links. (Update: The update didn't do squat to fix it...)",negative
"Still not uptomark cant view multiple answers, no night mode, inconvinent interface, etc.. still a long way to go, biased moderation policy.",negative
"After one too many rounds of stupidity from Quora ""moderation"" and the officially-sanctioned Eternal-Septembering of the site, I've given up. My time isn't worth a whole lot, but it's worth a whole lot more than that. I deleted my account and reclaimed the space on my phone. I strongly recommend avoiding Quora.",negative
Worst app ever to use. if u open on browser it doesn't let u read anything there and redirect here.,negative
One of the most amazing platforms to speak your heart out . In Quora you not only develop as a person and but when you read answers that sometimes answer some of the most burning questions to the complicated ones. I have to say that quora helped me become much more matured and helped me to grow as a person ..,positive
This app does not show anymore stories at my home since the only first use.....it just says about refreshing the page and doesn't show anythingüò†üò†üò†üò†üò†,negative
its great when people with great questions ask but you also get people who ask silly and non relevant. One moment your audience is on particle physics then someone wants to know how the tune to old mcdonald goes. Quora needs to separate audience to avoid losing great contributors. Over all? Great!!,positive
Even though I put my true details every time they block me from answering . Also the app automatically refresh whenever I read a article and I lost the content every time . Finally I can say it doesn't even deserve 1 star and I'm not gonna change my opinion,negative
"Please add some more languages Telugu, kannada which are major languages. Apart from this it's very satisfying.",positive
"I used the app, didn't like it. I prefer the mobile site but lately that insists on me switching to the app, which I don't want to do.",negative
"whack!I enjoy browsing quora sometimes.I don't have a lot of storage space on my phone to download another app but quora has decided that in order to enjoy Quora, we MUST download it.okay whatever I decided to download temporarily but the format of the app is whack I can't navigate as I choose and feel like Quora forces my experience. You're gonna lose a lot of people by forcing the experience because the beauty of the internet is that the individual is free to have their own unique experience.",negative
"The app frequently locks up for random lengths of time while I'm in the middle of typing an answer (the Quora website exhibits the same behavior, both on my Android smartphone and tablet). This makes answering questions a very frustrating experience. Barely usable.",negative
Love this app! I can scroll all day long. I love hearing people stories and seeing that all though we may be in different parts of the world....we have more in common than i ever realized.,positive
this is good apps to you whos looking for more knowledge to upgrade your self and your mind. in this platfrom you can sharing and learning with excellenct people.,positive
"My home page is not opening.. Everything else is working fine.. I uninstalled the app, installed it again, cleared cache, and what not.. still not opening.. please look into the matter..",negative
"Simply the best social medium possible! Any day better than fb, insta and twitter put together. Great app too!",positive
Well How Can I Say That How Much I Am Into This Application. I Just Download It And Everyday I Give Some Time To The App And Believe Me It Helps Me To Improve MySelf And Bonus There Are Many Intresting People And Intelligent People Whose Advices Are Very Good. This Can Answer Any Kind Of Problem That You Face. By The Way Love This App.,positive
very bad performance and buggy. Error messages are very common. refresh crashes. confusing interface. over all very bad for so much hype.,negative
good experience since using this app. I get my answers from experts in individual fields.,positive
i hate this app though i answered many questions it was showing them as spam and answered questions as zero.This was the worst app ever.Its better to try some other apps like careers 360 than trying this app,negative
this app hangs a lot. many times my feed would not load. its highly frustrating to use inspite of being a good platform,negative
This app is awesome which provides the where everyone shares his/her experiences and also provide information which is useful for the people.,positive
"Its a lot of fun. if you like learning new things everyday from interesting people, you will enjoy Quora.",positive
"Website used to be better than the app, but now the website is unusable due to forcing you to download the app. Quora is only useful on a PC these days which is useless to most people, including myself.",negative
Quora is a good app where I usually spend my free time but since past six months app is not working properly inspite of periodic updates. It takes a way more time to load images and app keep on getting crash in between.r,negative
Another boneheaded update. Why limit the feed and force me to tap an option to view more and not have the feature working?,negative
Improved since I last gave my rating. One thing I'd implore the developers to add is a dark/night mode. I mainly browse Quora at night in the dark and the blinding white theme is murder to one's eyes,neutral
had to download the app just to leave some sort of review. its ridiculous that you can't use the website on your phone until you're faced with that annoying pop up about the app. PLEASE allow people to exit out of that! and half the time I cant distinguish new articles vs replies to the current one vs ads vs recommendations cause they're all mixed together in some confusing jumble. phew. it just makes me quit out of frustration. and the app has it's own issues too.,negative
"since the lastest update the app homepage is not loading and showing ""err_spdy_protocol error"".kindly solve this.",negative
overall it was good but it doesn't function properly sometimes I click somewhere else and it gets clicked at some other place. most irritating was that picture donot appear properly or some times do not apper at all please help,negative
"@Quora, please stop forcing people to download app while reading from the mobile site. Having an immovable ad that blocks you from reading further on the mobile site is unimpressive and annoying. Nobody likes strongarm tactics. Therefore 1 star.",negative
"I like quora and how you can share knowledge on it, but I hate how hard it is to delete anything! I want to delete my account but I'm having complications, I want to delete some of my questions but I can't?! Please sort this out!!! Another thing is the amount of requests I got for answers. I answered 8 questions and suddenly I'm getting 14 requests in 2 days. It's overwhelming. Please delete my account and all of its posts/activity. Thank you.",negative
It is useless. The app crashes and excessively drains battery. Also the platform promotes racism and white supremacists ideas. A German guy who called Indians as inferior to white people was allowed to go unharmed but when I called him a racist I got a warning. I have left writing on this app since then. I want to encourage other Indians to leave this platform as well.,negative
There are few answers which I'm unable to open. I tried a lot to read those answers but was unable to do that. Or else the app is amazing but try to fix the problem of mine,negative
"under topic, you literally cannot select the tab for ""most viewed writers"", it just doesn't work. this is a serious bug. also, there's no way to change font size. that's a glaring accessibility issue. lastly, why can't the app preload more of a writer's answers in advance, why must i keep scrolling further and further down to load section by section?",negative
The worst user experience in mobile web page! I just downloaded app to give it the lowest rating because mobile page forced me to download this app while reading halfway through the article. Did not use the app itself but my rating is feedback on overall user experience.,negative
"Quora forces you to use the app even when the website is more than enough. It is an extremely annoying requirement. Forcing you to login is one thing, but forcing to use the app is going beyond being reasonable",negative
"Experience level is somewhat lesser than its browser's counterpart. Apps load much longer, options are a tad confusing whereas it's simpler on the browser. I would still prefer the more user friendly interface on browser albeit feature-rich monogamous app's interface. I just love to read multiple threads and making side notes..",neutral
Your extremely good website lost one star because I was forced to download the app. The website doesn't let me use it unless I have the app.,negative
"Another case of peoples stupidity. Your goal is to provide a good platform for knowledge exchange not to push your stupid app. Half way reaading through an article you force me to either install the app or stop reading and close the browser. I am mazaed how stupid is the manager that decided this is the way to go. Ok than, I installed the app to write this review, unintall your app, unsubscribe from the sites mailing list, and stop reading Quora. Hows that for customer satisfaction.",negative
A very nice app that gives you access to quality answers. but i wish to save some of the answers for future review which is difficult. so please developers add a save the page button for this accessibility.,positive
Now a days i am unable to upvote and any setting of logout is not showing.. Just frustrated by the qoura limitations,negative
Quora is indeed a great platform for learning. But the new features of sharing is somehow I personally found not that great. Sometimes it seems irrelevant and irritating.,negative
It's 2019 and this app still doesn't have the option for a dark mode. App takes forever to load and doesn‚Äôt work well on slow internet speeds.,negative
don't tell me to download the app continuously when i am reading it on any other browser. I just missed some of the good answers.,negative
I enjoy using Quora. I enjoy reading the topic questions and perspectives that differ from my own. I believe this app makes the world better and more peaceful. Since i have been using this app i have not noticed any issues or my phone running slow.,positive
"Good app and all, but it wouldn't let me use the browser and forced me to download the app. maybe that's just me being a bit weird but if I want to use the browser so I have more space on my phone, just let me please.",negative
"excellent possibilities here...I do enjoy it.....some of the posts are just annoying but ,overall, lots of possibilities...",positive
"If learning is like a journey, Quora provides the adequate mode of transport for the journey..",positive
loved it on my old phone but have never been able to use it on my new one. I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and it still won't work:(,negative
"Everytime I'm reading an article, the page (website) refresh and bring me here ""Download our fu*king app now"" & I lost my reading article. Even its sometimes directs me to other websites & ads. Its the perfect platform for ads & their own app advertisements.",negative
"whenever i am trying to open the app, it takes a lot of time to load current feed.",negative
"You just have to get used to it, then it's alright. The reply system is a little convoluted, like navigating a maze of 'click what?' and 'who did I just reply to?' ...but what are you gonna do? It's functional.",neutral
"I've personally learned more on this app than I have on most others due to enormously huge contributions spawning over tens of millions, which spread across varying topics from; social to finance to religion to politics, etc. I would with utmost confidence, reccomend quora to anyone looking to broaden their knowledge in any field as it literally offers the best of the best of everything there is to learn",positive
I feel inspired while reading...its a platform to share stories of their lives and their struggles.,positive
I enjoy the articles daily but I'm not a fan of the vulgar language I see. What happened to common decency or at least editing?,negative
Getting annoyed!!! When i switch to app from my search result and when i tap on continue reading it scrolls back to top of page instead of extending the answer,negative
had to download this app and waste 10 mins just to read a single article because... i apparently cannot read the remain few lines on the browser because... the app will is supposed to give better experience.... GREAT!,negative
The idea is good but Quora app is the worst app when it comes to handling the images. It can't open the images with answer but user have to click on every single image to view them. Also App hangs a lot when you write an answer. Lot of scope for improvement.,negative
"Mute, block functions hardly work at all. This app really sucks, like Quora in general sucks. And moderation is by far the worst of any social media platform.",negative
Got to know some fantastic people with great knowledge and wonderful perspectives towards things. Quora has been an enriching and enlightening experience for me.,positive
"When I open Quora using Chrome, Quora keep asking me to read more using app. and my reading interrupted. Please don't make that pop up again. I don't want to waste my phone memory for just to open your app, and I still can read using Chrome.",negative
"Most helpful aap... it's helpful in various ways like study , getting the trending searches & also gaining knowledge ...You can interact with people & can clear your doubts about any topics... I'm thankful to the owner of the aap...",positive
"The Quora app is easy to use. I have had no problems. I find the Quora app simply, functional and very user friendly.",positive
"Forces you to download mid reading using the site, I had no problem reading on the site without an app taking space and memory on my phone for no reason",neutral
New update is not good at all. unable to view images like before. improve it.,negative
Not satisfied with this app. when I press read more it shows no internet everytime even though my data is on.,negative
"Overall my experience has been positive. There's an answer that i replied to a question about Charlie Manson where i got quite a few negative responces to, reguarding my answer being incorrect. Other than that, i'd say i've had a pretty good experience on here.",positive
what i hate about this app is that once u have opted for it u can't be out of it..they simply wouldn't allow u to delete your account or deactivate it,negative
"What say about this, this is really the very good app i ever seen. Good job team quora to bring such an good platform for us. Really thankyou.",positive
satisfied reading material. Lots of opinions. There are links connecting to accurately sorted data.,neutral
"I LOVE QUORA!! There's so much valuable information and i appreciate the people who share thier personal experiences with us. Also, gives us a chance to upvote and respond to the writer.",positive
The app is annoying. reading on Chrome is way better. but cant even do that peacefully now because ads for rhis app keep popping up,negative
"Theres rather a lot of silly or even ridiculous questions to plough through and its not easy to get back to a page. i havent learned how to 'control' it yet so cant even find any advice (if there is any). Just random things on my home page. Its pot luck if i find something interesting! Luckily there are some very thought provoking questions and good stories and replies in amongst the silly questions! I do like it, in spite of all this.",negative
Always forcing users to download the app. Can't even see a single answer properly on their website. The website keep popping and asking us to download the app.,negative
"I thought it was a good practice(and a sensible one) to provide information about updates. This is 3rd time I am receiving an update without any info what the update does. Come on, is it that difficult? Few lines of description is too much work? I will improve the rating, when you provide desciption of update.",negative
uninstalled the app as it was not working properly and no response from developer. now they force to download the app,negative
"No response -My Account deleted itself and I don't have any idea in the least why it happened - all I know is I was using the app and suddenly screen went white for few seconds and I was logged out of my account and then I tried to login using Google Signin and I was introduced as a new user - everything I ever wrote - asked, answered, upvoted - simple disappeared. I tried to reach Quora through email and requested if they could explain what exactly happened but they cared to reply and explain.",negative
"I enjoy this app. People post interesting questions and I can learn from them, some imbeciles post things utterly rediculous which are quite humouress to read and reply to.",positive
These latest updates are very much up to the mark. but just one more piece of request. If possible kondly add a black layout to the app as dark layout is a thing these day and this would very much compliment overall UI of new phones.,positive
it's five stars for me I like the way you get your selections you can look up the music you can look up movies you can look up everything you want and still get more out of it so when you do the surgery when you do any of thing or not on phones far as look for something the quality out of it,positive
"Answers are very technical and useful to the interested persons. Of course, for some questions, to get an answer it takes more time. Anyhow, subject is being discussed. Keep it up.",positive
It doesn't let me read online a popup comes up and tells to install the app I don't need the app please correct this.,negative
It is a very good platform for learning through various ways. U can see your problems through different angles. very nice answers I had got through quora. U can interact with intelligence and intellect at the same platform.,positive
I just want to use from browser don't need app. Stop giving pop up to download and not letting me use.,negative
"I don't review apps much, but Quora provides a lot of valuable knowledge. This often comes to me from personalised emails that instantly grab my attention and answer questions that I didn't even form yet. I recommend Quora to anyone who values online learning and is curious about pretty much anything and everything because Quora usually always has highly clever people with answers to almost any questions.",positive
I used to love writing in this app but recently see that one gets bombarded with the dumbest questions to answer. I know people wanna make money with their program and leads people to ask as many dumb random questions to et points. I cant any longer if they dont figure out how to weed out the unnecessary meaningless questions. You also have to regulate some of these senior quorans who feel like they are on a pedestal and make new people feel as if they beneath them. Loved the app but fix it.,negative
Quora forced me to download the app. i prefer the mobile web page. but quora pop-up is forcing to download the app to browse the content. hence 1 star,negative
"gave it a 5 star rating long ago... 1 star now, ads were barely noticeable, then noticable, then promoted answers get repeated at irritating frequency, tap an answer's read more link/button ... ‚Öû times it redirects you to an advertisement ... which is frustrating.... and some of the legendary writers are getting blocked for having a voice.. tap an answer.. some other sponsored answer pops up instead of the one I clicked",negative
"It's pretty good but I think the aesthetic could be better. However I gave four stars because I don't want your guy's site be unsuccessful, it's really fun actually to help give advice to people out there and I'm working on giving in-depth answers more.",positive
"I believe your latest version is inconsistent. Everytime I open a feed, it redirects to some other. And also the images posted are not visible in one go,",negative
"it's easy to all things ask and read throigh widget, please update it with some widgets, otherwise i will give it 5 stars.",positive
the latest update is having many Bugs....please make changes and update with a new version.....basically i am not able to click on options in a topic...like most answered question / related topic /,negative
"one star for forcing me to download it. the website is BETTER than the app anyway, so the forced app wastes my memory and time. bad move, Q. let me enjoy your stupid platform in peace. also, bring back question details. that one pointless update did more than any other to destroy your site's quality.",negative
Feed updates get hung up. The website feed is much better. I don't understand why they force you to use the app when advertising is identical to the website!,negative
Giving zero star because you web app ask to use app. Why to use app only instead of browser. Remove that sticky note for using app only in web app. Web app not occupy space like mobile app. Watched others review and got to know that how dumb are the developer.,negative
what's wrong with this app. pics on screen doesn't show fully. its automatically cropped. please fix this issue.,negative
most of the times u need not to ask questiins and wait for the answers. Instead will find that ur question has already been posted with a number of answers. Not only this u will also get many useful related questions about the topic. this is a very useful app.,positive
Very engaging and interactive. Results are fast and easy to evaluate.,positive

I tried many times to reinstall the app but result is the same. I already have sent an email regarding the issue. But there is no reply till now. I tried using through chrome browser, but there you all will have a pop up which you can not close, and it just sticks there. It is all creepy experience in browser and in app altogether.",negative
I was using Quora on my mobile browser but it keeps saying to download the app and there is no way you could close that popup. I don't want to download your app and now won't be using quora as well.,negative

"Force download of app is reprehensible. I have almost stopped using Quora altogether because of this - I get the email and see something interesting, click on the link to the article, and halfway through the pop-up for the app comes up, and that's the end of it. Can't get back to where I was. Just not worth the hassle. SO ANNOYING!!!!",negative
extremely satisfying and reliable application!love the answer that satisfies my question.even google doesn't have that level accuracy in finding solutions to our problems.Hats off to the adminüí™üí£ü§ó,positive
This app is great except for the damn bots. The credential reviewing system is BS. No matter what I put as my credentials they are rejected. Every single time! Please look into this.,negative
The ease of reading articles is not good as whenever I read an article a popup comes giving only two options either download the app or you have the app already.,negative
I think this is the best app for beginners to seek advice from the professionals... But please remove the limit of characters to add a question because it can help people to explain their problems or situations.... Btw best app to ask questions on any topic.. I love it.. üôÇ üôÇ,positive

The stories people write here are usually very interesting and sometimes captivating.,positive
"This is the first time I'm actually disappointed with an app, I've never given a negative remark but this, Quora used to be a bloody amazing platform, over the time I joined up until now its become a place infested only with garbage like topics on relationship, sex and pornography which has a 90% Indian population giving advices. There needs to be some regulation to the amount of content in each topic to preserve the quality but the Quora Partnership Program killed it for everyone.",negative
Gone through some writings. Found intersting and knowledge worthy. A good platform for gathering informations.,positive
"works well, but they could improve the UI. its not very intuitive to use.",negative

very slow app...so much hang.. content not show properly... can't select text... pictures not showing...,negative
Make the topics I have followed easily accessible in a list form. And why I get automatically followed to all Reliance groups without my consent. I agree you are a free application and you need to earn but that doesn't mean you have to make us follow someone which we don't want.,neutral
this is an app that answers all your questions regarding various aspects of life that one may come across. i use it very often to find about the place i am going to whether it be a college or a tourist spot.,positive
Locks up quite often. Everytime i use the App it will freeze for 30 sec to one minute. Very irritating if I am typing a response or new post.,negative

Since after reinstalling too, the problem is not getting resolved so i m giving it only 2 stars.",negative
"Very nice app and useful. Good topics, I learned a lot and still learning new things specially with regards to linguistic and critical skills regardless if i agree or not with some opinions or information shared by members. It is good to recognize others cultures, Ideas and thoughts that deepen one's realization and correct some misconception in a polite manner. Thank you",positive
The website forces you to register for reading articles. Once you register for the site it forces you to download the app. wish there was a way to block this website on google searches.,negative
Application not very iteractive at all. feels like a web version and very laggy with glitches. Quora team needs to develop a dedicated app which is intiutive and interactive at the same time in a small pacage.,negative
"This is a fantastic app which gives you answer to every weird, intelligent, logical question.",positive
Takes too much of data and space. The quality has also degraded with unnecessary updates.,negative
"I was asking a question, and it prompted me to download the app. The popup was not closable and my question was lost after I had to quit the browsing session. I'd be more inclined to download the app if it wasnt an agressive popup that was ruining my user experience, thanks.",negative
You cant read article or post unless within the app & forces you buy having a pop to download the app. Its a weaker Reddit app wannabe.,negative
"Quora is wonderful but the android app has become horrible. Even after the update it's very slow, not user friendly, sometimes the contents are not loading, to expand an answer or a comment you have to click on it for about zillion times. Never seems like a good android app. It feels like visiting an unsupported desktop site from a mobile. Please fix these issues.",negative
"most questions can be solved by Google or YouTube, the amount of unintelligent propaganda re: how great Apple products are, is mind numbing, and moderation is the most spineless system possible",negative

Quora is a very good website but recently i see they are forcing us to use the app when opened in the browser.i don't understand y do u guys do that its really annoying.,negative
very good platform for imparting unbiased knowledge and information. Real store-house or reservoir of knowlege on all topics. Very useful indeed. I have got addicted to it.,positive
Lots of information and experiences shared on this platform. A must have App if you are a curious person or career driven with some doubts.,positive
Its very good app to get your quries solved and upgrade your information. At the same time their should be a way of knowing whether answers are accurate or not.,positive
"TBH, i prefer using web browsers than the Quora app. The fonts are too small in the app but with web browsers, i can zoom in and zoom out",positive
"The only reason I downloaded this is to give it 1 star. It forces people to download its app when we read articles in the web. This in my view is highly unethical, unprofessional and anti-choice behavior. Never going to use your app devs.",negative
it is a platform an open window for those who I want to know know response to their queries from experts... Specialists from many field are under one canopy answer many intriguing questions very comfortably... of course one question with many answer means multi dimensional perception Quora is a friend in hand,positive

I enjoy Quora so much because it gives me the answer not olny answer but an explaination to every question every issue either it is religious or cultural or spiritual....the best platform for everyone to manipulate all the required knowledge and use it in wiser ways or perform it on humanitarian grounds for the wellbeing of humanityüòçthe main and a huge advantage of its usage leads us to make ourselves the magnificient and great writers‚ò∫,positive
Really great to hear from real life people and benefit from their real life experiences. Immense amount of topics. Anything you may think of. And users are invited to add more topics if they don't find what they're looking for.,positive
The app is not opening since last night. It's showing the message -6: net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET Please get the issue fixed.,negative

"I find the app itself offers limited features for being such a well-known site for so long! It doesn't even have a spell-checker, and maneuvering the site while posting and reading is tiresome.

Nowadays my feed is overly cluttered with lot of ads, most basic and uninteresting questions, topics and authors that Quora is constantly trying to push on me although I've already muted them.

Good Q/As. But the thing is App's UX. It is horrible. Answers are opening correctly and sometimes wrong answers are opened. Allow to close the expanded comments,negative
so annoyed If I wanted to open the story I'm reading in the app I would. but instead of allowing me to just finish the answers section its constantly blocking with open in the app. and surprise surprise now it doesnt want to work and i still dont get to finish what i was reading. I want to read it online END OF STORY why screw it up. just let me see it the way I want. Or dont bother me with your stupid email cuz I'm not. interested is some app that diesnt provide the service it's there to provid,negative
blocks questions from being answered due to spelling errors or what the computer picks up as an error. questions can't be too long. can't post any questions unless full first and last name. just very finicky and tedious and annoying,negative
STOP TRYING TO FORCE ME TO DOWNLOAD! I just want to read some things every now and then but then the download image comes up and I can't escape it. This is not my main phone and its old with very limited space. I have 6 apps and I'm not deleting them for Quora. Quora is so annoying with the screen lock download button I refuse to download it on my main phone.,negative
I can find many sources of questions that I like. Many experiences regarding the people shares too. It's just sometimes crash but it doesnt stop me to be a Quoran.,positive
Awesome app. I have been using this app for 3years. It's a really good app to improve knowledge. There are sever types of topics on this app. You can also share your opinion on this app.. Overall my experience was awesome.,positive
"I've always have had a tough time loading photos, they almost never do...I have to click on every single blank space to open the photo",negative
"Just a horrible experience to use. Constantly asking me for feedback that takes up a third of the screen. ""Topics"" that you cany search ot select. Poor design layout. And few responses and hard to find selectocr content.",negative
"Absolutely delightful app. The discussions-- questions, answers, and comment--are insightful, well-wtitten and real food for thought, as opposed to the skreeds that dominate so many other forums.",positive
mostly functional quite good I suggest but choose and curate many topics to beat the algorithm which may pigeonhole you as desiring of gibberish,neutral
I was reading some article on the website and I was prompted to download the app. I didn't want to download the app but the site literally forced me to do so otherwise I couldn't continue reading on the site. This ridiculous and appalling. You simply can't force someone to download your app especially if you already have a website that does the same thing!! I'm very pissed right now!!,negative
Not bad. It is average. I can use it over a year. I write answer to any questions but few times this apps doesn't functioning properly. Otherwise it's ok.,neutral
"Great platform for curious people! I suggest adding a descriptive column for a question, as sometimes I (questioner) have to state my own thesis or explain my situation, which shall make the question quite long.",positive
it's a good forum where in all the practicality of the life routine is shared by different people. which is very informative and useful to adopt ...,positive
"It says that you can only use this app if you are 13 or older- which is ridiculous because the content I read on there in the first minute of getting the app was definitely 18+ and was super disturbing, gross, uneducational, wrong, and just plain weird. The things I read should not be condoned or seen as ""ok"" in any way shape or form. so please use discretion if your easily disturbed or to young...",negative
I enjoy Quora but I don't want the app until I get a faster phone. Mine just can't handle any extra. So you butt into something I'm reading or put an advertisement for your own app that can't be moved. There are other places where I can revel in the minds of my peers without being so ham-handled. I'll do without.,negative
"I LOVEüíúLoVeüíïüíö this app!! It's been AMAZING to read other people's stories and realizing that I have been through the same stuff and I'm NOT crazy is accelerating!! I feel so bad for the ppl effected by narsissitic ppl, everything they went through and how they gave themselves and their hearts to ppl they THOUGHT were the love of their life. It's a VERY heartbreaking thing to go through, & u r left to put yourself back together~ Alone:(( So, it's amazing to come here & not b alone anymore)!!",positive
"This app is great. No in-app purchases, no intrusive ads, best content and all for free. Provides a lot of knowledge. Looking forward for new features. I definitely recommend it to everyone.",positive
"They pay people to ask questions. as a result there are a lot of duplicate and generic questions that nobody actually cares what the answer is. They also allow people to opine under the guise of fact, another place for self-righteous people to virtue signal. I've asked several real (difficult or specific) questions and not received a useful answer",negative
the app is awesome when it comes to broadening the social horizon and as well it's a good source of reliable information..,positive
"Stop forcing people to install the app. I just installed it to write this review, now I'm going to delete it and unsubscribe from the mailing list.",negative
"This application is a piece of trash. installed yesterday, worked for 15 minutes and the ""500. Internal Server Error"" - refresh, works for a minute or two and then, same error message. Repeat the process and then stopped the insanity. What a complete waste of programming time and my 30 minutes of patience...",negative
All answers are correct. Though some answers may be short insufficient to fully explain the questions.,neutral
"If you put an insufferable obtrusive pop-up asking me to download your app on your mobile site, I'm going to install it, review it then uninstall it. whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be fired.",negative
"the app fails repetitively on error 503 or something. not just this but the website as well at times. sometimes it shows ""we are experiencing difficulties......."" when we access the website/ app. please correct and prevent. its been too long now.",negative
"Dear Quora, This is my first review ever on playstore and it's totally NOT because I loved your app but out of sheer frustration and anger for forcing me to install the app midway through an article of my interest. Why to push an user to install an app who is satisfied by your webpage? I DON'T WANT ANOTHER STUPID APP JUST TO NOTIFY ME ABOUT THING I DO ON A DAILY BASIS. So just shut the hell up and let me use the chrome version as I like it better than the app.",negative
Everything is amazing except the quora moderation. It's very unpredictable and even collapses the answers which didn't hurt the bnbr policies etc.,positive
The text is too small to read. It's better on Chrome where I only have to rotate my phone through 90¬∞ and back to have the text supersize. I can't see any advantage at all in G using the app.,negative
"I have been a quora fan since years, after last update the app is totally broken.  It says it cant load stuff.",negative
Was very interesting but now it is cursed with too many advertisements and a LOT of imbecilic questions.,negative
"Why is Quora forcing people using the phone browser to download the app? I keep getting an ad to download the app which blocks my entire screen and I can't close it. Thought this was a community for people to share with each other, how does it matter from where? Why is it being hijacked like this?",negative
"I enjoy reading Quora daily. I scan through the topics to my interests and read away. I get to see others points of view, compare them to my own. It's perfect for a quick lunch break read or a bedtime session. I recommend.",positive
steal data from other apps. i don't know how. you keep talking about something on whatsapp or google somethin on your phone. come back to quora and voila you find questions and topics suggestions related to your previous data in other app,negative
"Can't use app, switch from wifi to data but still tells me that I still need to connect to the Internet. Don't know what's wrong, all other apps work and I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it",negative
Most useless app ever. its just a website which should work in any phone browser. they need to harvest more personal data so they need an app. i wont be downloading it. thanks rather read something else.,negative
"Its really annoying how i had to doanload this app because i was forced to from the website, i like the website much better and i dont like the app, just let me read my article without prompting me to install your app and then not allowing me to close out of the prompt.",negative
After the latest update it is usually slow and after refreshing questions are not visible.,negative
"before uodate five stars were given by me and in comment i wrote simply ""undescribed"" but after update i feel very frustrated.Quora not responding since uodate . now i gave one star.I was getting the update notice from last few couple of months.But i was ignoring as i knew update of the most apps are not useful.But today quora stoped working and it was compulsion on me to update. and same happened to me.I am unable to understand why any company/organisation ruin it product. not responfing",negative
i don't want to download the app. i have a perfectly fine working browser. stop forcing me to dowbload it.,negative
app not opening at all. i dont know why its showing 'no internet connection' Everytime i open the app. My internet is working fine. Quora isnt even opening in Chrome browser.,negative
"Changed my default language to Hindi without asking, wasn't able to use the app for a while. Sends notification or question recommendations by default, really annoying.",negative
This app surely has a lot of bugs of which I can't explain as I am not a person with technical knowledge but they keep pestering. Kindly acknowledge this feedback.,negative
Very helpful to increse intellect as well improve overall personality by constantly surfing..,positive
"reading other people's stories and learning from their experiences is the best way to improve personally and this app does the job quite well but I think some adjustments can be made to design because it feels cluttered.Plus I wish if you add a a way to bookmark a question not only an answer to read it later Edit: pictures not loading properly or not loading at all , fix it already it has been like a week or so fix the damn thing please , it has been like weeks",positive
"good app, just please give the user some flexibility. Add text selectivity and images download. This way we can safe much time with facts checking",positive
"I had to download so that I can complain. First, I've been receiving emails from you for years and now, you're forcing me to download the app? Not right. I was reading something and couldn't finish, because of that. Second, I wanted to contact you and you answered my question with a whole line of other questions with answers. I hate that. So robotic and unreal. Third, I'm deleting my account, because I've been treated like this. I don't want another app on my phone. I'm done.",negative
Forced me to install app when i was happy reading on the browser. no option to continue read on browser.,negative
I have to be honest I definitely enjoy reading your content. however I don't understand why I have to download this app. why can't I just read them online. just another app taking up space. I'm sorry I know why you want me to download the app it is because you want my information. information is money right.,negative
"its my decision whether to install your app or read it in browser. why every time you are forcing users to install your app, without letting users to read what they have started. I am totally annoyed by this kind of behaviour and this is happening for the 6th or 7th time.",negative
I have a problem with quora android app which is the images are not loading in the feeds or in the answers to any question.. the images are replaced with a white blank space. can you help me in this problem please ...,negative
I have found quora the best place to get an honest straight answer from experts. Very difficult to get answers with the volume of resources online these days. If you want to find out something like the value of an MBA or a particular school you will get answers that really clear your worry. From real experts that are not incentivised to write about something but offering honest reliable advice. Highly recommended this APP.,positive
annoying trying to get me to own the app when I am an existing user. And clicking on the current user bar is WORTHLESS@,negative
"very Intelligent,Intetesting and knowledgeable questions. I have answered with full interest. I passed some questions because I have no knowledge about those.Very,very knowledgeable Questions. Wish your concern all the best in your efforts. N.Murugesan.",positive
it comes on my screen and offers me the free app i allready have. if i exits to goes to play store. if i go to playstore it wont go away. since i have the app allready i believe i will just delete it and try something else. have a nice day,neutral
"I'm about to give up Facebook for Quora. Seriously, my dudes, you all did a good thing with this platform. I love answering questions and being challenged by new ideas, and Quora had done got my attention in real time. I am quite fond of it and hold all y'all in high regard.",positive
"Worst app. For sign in, when I click the checkbox that I am not robo then it tell me to select all squares with that photo or whatever for verification. And it does not verify it always giving me that squares for sign in. I don't want to give 1 star also but it is compulsory to give for me to review. Worst of Worst Apps",negative
"awesome. i was asked to join the partner program, asking questions and getting paid. i have answered a few, but havent asked any. I kinda feel like they should pay for answering instead of asking. Right?",positive
wost app. there was no use of it. I was happy with quora on chrome but they are forcing us to install this useless app.When i was busy reading an article they forced me to download this stupid app. Going to uninstall it.,negative
I was forced into installing the app in order to read an article I was reading on my phone. Wasted 2 minutes to open an app that is slow and does not even let me log in. It even required for me to make an account. Give me a break please.,negative
Rating 1 star because you can't browse the website without getting an UNCLOSABLE popup to use the app. Whatever intern designed that feature really left a bad impression on millions of people. Message to the developers: your website isn't good enough for people to want to install a whole dedicated app for it lmao.,negative
"I love reading all the stories, I laugh, cry and learn from them! Thank you for the opportunity to be part of this wonderful app!üòäüíñ",positive
it's a good app overall. You can request a question to specific persons as well as to general public. Response rate is good.,positive
Excellent reading and swapping of opinions. Some of the questions really challenge my brain and as an older person I must do that everyday. Quora is the greatest.,positive
"This is my first and only review, and I can't believe you actually pissed me off enough to go to the trouble. I didn't want this app, I dont like this app, I was perfectly happy on chrome. Apparently you can no longer visit quora without an app. jerks.",negative
"However good or bad this app is, is only secondary to the fact that I was *forced* to download the app in order to continue reading an article that had already loaded in my browser. The fact that being logged into their website is no longer good enough, tells me that quora is taking an actively user-hostile approach in order to maximise revenue. What a waste of time!",negative
very good platform to gather Knowledge and information. one Can also Express their View and Expertise.,positive
"this thing forced me to download app to finish reading a story. A huge obnoxious popup blocked the screen when I was in the middle of reading a story on their web page. It was impossible to remove.I am gonna finish reading my story, if I can find it again, and then I will delete the app.",negative
"Undoubtedly one of the very best applications I've ever downloaded. Personally, as a person that really enjoys learning new things, gaining/offering knowledge and writing - this is the place to do all of the above. I've been using it for a few years now, and I would definitely recommend!",positive
I wish i could give you more than this but no. I can't. You guys are forcing people to download the app when the user is midway an article. That is not cool.,negative
It was fun before to read rare stuffs some interesting facts and get some knowledge Now it's full of unlogical questions and stupid answer it would be great if you rove all the stupid question and answer and make it an app to share knowledge.,negative
One of the worst platform I have ever came across. I don't know why it is being overrated by the people. Deletes all my answers even if they fits to their policy. My entire hardwork in constructing those gets wasted. I hate it. Worst platform. I have asked them to delete my account. A suggestion to people who are reading this if you are looking to help people with your solutions. *DON'T USE QUORA* Deserve a -5 Star,negative
quora is an excellent platform for solving queries of our and others but this aap is very slow and needs very fast internet speed to work properly I think this problem must be reviewed,negative
"If you want to know something new and interesting facts of day to day life .This app really teaches you something new related to your area of interest and something that will make you surprised . it is very good platform to interact with persons having good knowledge and experience. if you have any confusion regarding your future , just follow quorans.",positive
one of the best application for each student and every profession.we can find congnitive information from this application and also get precise knowledge.I recommen every student to use quora instead of any other sources for any type of difficulty,positive
it very irritating that I am unable to read quora from any browser even when logged in. its unethical to compel someone to intall an app even if he has accepted other terms and conditions while signing up. I will have to uninstall the app. And kindly remove such compulsion as Quora may be liable for complaints to the authorities for such coercion.,negative
I have been using the app for years now but I hate that they keep forcing one to download the app when I'm completely comfortable with the chrome page version... I keep on downloading and deleting so that I use it in chrome.,negative
"Cant pull down to refresh, and tap abit buggy, the post that I tapped on is not the post that opens.",negative
"Dear Quora, PLEASE let me read the quora feed in the browser PEACEFULLY. I will be reading a nice lengthy article and the quora app download pop up comes!!! I can't close the pop up & I have to close the tab in the mobile browser. Don't SPAM the pop up suggestion. I will download the app if I want to, don't force it!!!!",neutral
whenever i demotivate quora help me a lot..it is very fantastic app.. download it and read the experience of many people to make ur life better every single day....,positive
"If I have already logged in to your website, why do I have to download the stupid app? I may not have space on my phone, or poor internet in my area that caused the app to be not installed. Why do you have to 'force' us to install the app. This is bad customer service. Disappointed.",negative
its wonderful app u can ask your any quiry regarding any subject and moreover its a good platform for english learner u would improve your language,positive
it's good for many questionsüí≠‚ùì it's help me alot and whenever I bored :( i go to QUORA and then set my mind. it's really really good for me because whatever I want knowledge-able things I check on QUORA. üëåüå∏üå∏üå∏üåº,positive
Downloaded and uninstalled to tell you that it is HEAVILY frustrating that you force a user to download the app. Unsubscribed and uninstalled.,negative
"I suggest that users be allowed to view answers to questions when using the merge feature in the Quora app. This is not currently available. I have to use the desktop view in Chrome to be able to view answers. This is cumbersome and defeats the purpose of the app. Also, I've noted difficulty in adding links to answers using the app. Specifically, the app adds the entire text of links with formatting that cannot be changed. These issues should be addressed.",negative
Most of the topics are informational. Reading experience is nice till date. Some of the questions are based on our day to day life experiences as well. Providing information in question and answer format makes this user friendly,positive
"I don't like your name policies, i have entered my full name but it keeps being flagged as ""not real"" .Update your site so that we as users can put any name we desire even Numbers should be considered as names too.",negative
"It's ok and I learned a lot but I get tons of emails and I don't like that, for a lot of dome questions just because they make money asking them. I guess I could too but I don't like to ask stupid questions.",negative
installed just so I could rate 1 star. wish i could give it 0. users should want to download your app out of convenience. forcing us to download it in the middle of reading an article on your perfectly viable webpage is intrusive and avsolutely unnecessary.,negative
The app doesn't always work smooth. Random error pops up in between. Its a simple interface but still slow.,negative
"used to be so smooth and everything but now it crashes every time. no matter how many times I've updated it, the feed does not refresh and no it's not my phone neither a connection issue. please fix this or a wonderful app will lead itself to its doom. Two stars because i still love quora and hope it gets well soon.",negative
"recentally found ...quora owner and facebook owner were the same classmate ...... but quoro is much better than any social media (specially for me) because reading is quit interesting than anyother activity ,until your a extrovert...... but i think it would be better if quora has black theme ...... because i use quoro most at night ..... i will prefer black theme in quora ...... might be the best update",positive
"I was searching for a platform after I quited Facebook. Finally I guess I found what I was looking for. Great place to spend my quality time. Btw, the app responds slowly after spending 30-40 mins at a stretch. Plus, I would like to have a 'dark mode/theme'.",positive
"terrific site, powered by people writing thoughtful answers to serious questions. So far I haven't found an exception to that. A great resource for its readers",positive
"Fantastic site, badly done app - it times out with 'bad connection, 504' etc even when other apps work fine, and if you get the emails with interesting answers, it forces you to use the app, and then doesn't connect so you can't read anything.",negative
Better platform than most apps both educational and social. This has been my go to app and I've been using fb more less.,positive
"Its a great app for sharing knowledge and to share experiences with other people,but it must have a dark mode option also",positive
it's okay. meh. many opinionated know it all's on here. Although I've received a few helpful answers. Lately the app will not respond when I press on the fields on my mobile phone. The navigation isn't as intuitive as I'd like it to be. There is an update available. I will try it and hope for better results.,negative
Best platform to get answers of any questions. you can also take advice from the legend. it's very best for everyone.,positive
"Excellent, amazing, great,,. surely this is one of the best app u can download from play store.. this is a treasure of knowledge",positive
"i love quora, it is educating, inspiring, and a sounding board when you need to vent your ideas and feelings.",positive
"I've been happily using quora on my browser on my tablet, because it's an older tablet and I need to limit the number of app on it. Lately Quora has started trying to force me to to use the app by locking the browser screen with a pop up to download the app. There is no way to close the pop up or opt out of using the app. So instead, I will just stop using your service at all.",neutral
"For me its best platform to share our views, ideas, and experiences too. Even, we don't know how to start something different in our lives but Quora, gives us the way by questioning and answering.",positive
so far so good. people in general are knowledgeable. some people dont frame their questions properly.,positive
"I am not sure why, App is not at all working with my Onplus 6t device. its keep loading even if i keep for half an hour. is every with other devises also facing same issue??",negative
I really enjoyed it however a lot of the questions don't have places for me post my response and it is not easy to navigate,negative
very bad user experience. hard to use and not user friendly at all.,negative
One star because: 1. Forces you to download the app 2. Spams notifications and emails even when disabled,negative
"i love quora, i explored a lot of questions there, maybe one day i will be the resources for others too. it is amazing to be able to see others people thought so that i can explore more perspective of many things.. yeah i am happy..",positive
"i just loved quora and a old user of it. i have learn so many things from this app and answered a lot of questions. i want to give all the shining Stars to this app. now i want to join QPP partner programme but didn't get any invitation,will you please review my profile and give me chance to earn for my living.",positive
was forced to download app while I was reading a post. there is no way to close the popup. now that I have left this review. I will be deleting the app,negative
"so far I was flagged for my name. I went to fix it and the site crashed several times. man, development and ppl today are not like what they used to be.",negative
Website forces me to download the app (non-dismissable popup) and then doesn't even redirect me to the correct article. Then pressing back brings you to the Quora homepage and you've lost the article forever... I guess I'll just unsubscribe from Quora Digest.,negative
It's an useful site... Mainly for those people who love to learn new things and always curious about different things,positive
"First, i love Quora and i used to enter the site a lot. But the app loads so slowly, and if you scroll the screen to the top mistakenly- the page reload again in it slowly loading. So my rating for the site is 5, but for the app-3. Sorry...",positive
"Don't know what's wrong with Quora app. Contents never load, just a blank white screen. last day I waited about 10 minutes. There is no problems with my internet, i reinstalled but still same issue. Please fix",negative
"I was disappointed to not be able to use this app on Android 4.4.3 since I had a phone that would not update. I have since bought a new phone since the old one had a defective charging port that couldn't be replaced, but I really wish Quora and other apps would continue to support older phones and tablets that still work just fine.",negative
"No, I don't want to sign up. Leave me be, and stop putting every second question behind a signup wall. Off to desktop.",negative
You guys think that forcing people to download the app by putting a non closable popup after a few seconds will make you popular. No it doesn't. if you ever bothered to read reviews you would see people are complaining about it and you won't listen. you don't care. you keep forcing people to install the app.,negative
"my suggestion if a print or save to gallery options if text was their means.it would be much more greater,because some information has to noted always taking screen shot is too hard !!! i hape this might gey change soon",neutral
"it would at least a 4 star rating if there were NO ANNOYING ADS?!, so if this updated versions ads take up too much time??, I will be deleting this app. thank you.",negative
"why do you need to popup in between,telling me to install the app, when i am reading an article?? it breaks the flow man",negative
Changing fonts is not possible. This is a major downside. Requesting the developers to fix the issue.,negative
Good content. Crappy deisgn and usability for both the app and website. Also forces you to install the app halfway through reading something.,positive
"I really love quora and spent more time on it more than any SNS per day. But suddenly my feeds are gone and i was suggested to discover following topics despite I already followed some topic, the option to select topics on feeds is gone to. Please resolve this",positive
"Love Quora to death, but a lot of times I click on my feed on the app and stuff does not load. It shows a refresh button but nothing comes up. I then have to go to the mobile version to keep reading things.",negative
"love the app no doubt. I have been Quora's regular user for past 3 years. I use it at least half an hour everyday, it's the best source of entertainment, knowledge sharing and good experience sharing. The only problem the app has is that sometimes when we click on one answer the other shows up and this is persistent throughout a lot of releases, I guess the delay time to load the whole answer causes this, this hurts the User experience a bit. Either way love the app.",positive
"I don't know if this problem is with everyone or not, but my feed sometimes can't be refreshed. most of the time the page says ""no stories for you, please come another time"" or something like that. i think theie server is down most of the time. otherwise app is superb and I learned so mucb from it.",negative
Forced to download this app by an intrusive pop-up. This is a disgusting tactic used to boost stats. Do the decent thing and discipline those responsible. Unethical and dishonest.,negative
"I'd like to leave a higher review but for NO reason whatsoever my feed is bombarded by politics! Ita insane, I dont follow any political aubjectt yet that is literally my ENTIRE feed. Politics are interesting by my goodness, i need a break!",negative
"Can't bother rating an app higher when it actually forces you to install it. i was in the middle of reading a great answer using quora on browser and it refused to let me continue unless I installed the app, which i did. But guess what? The answer I was reading was gone because the page refreshed and I cannot find it now.",negative
"The best app, uninstall all time wastage apps. spend the most valuable time with this app. I mostly recommend this. Loves itüòç",positive
"interesting topics - some a little off the wall, some not in my league. good to see so many experienced and knowledgable people contributing to help others.",positive
"Please undo the update, I don't want to have to click on an answer request &have four options to choose from like send them a message each time I send an answer request. just trying to slow people down from earning money.",negative
"somehow,after the last update quora is not getting downloaded in my phone and the reason is not clear to me. I have benn using this app for last 2 years,now out of nowhere it's not working.",negative
It's my first review and I'm writing it with sheer frustration from that unavoidable pop up. I'm enjoying your chrome version better than your app. Don't force users to install it.,negative
Its a just an excellent app to learn more and more. Noy only we can get information but also we r get the opportunity to answer and learn more and more things.,positive
It's really good except loading answers and then pictures in the answers can really take some time. And sometimes when you switch between apps it leaves the answer you were reading and returns to the top of your feed or where you were before you opened the answer.,positive
"I don't want the app. The browser version works fine. Quora forces me to use the app - presumably to push even more ads than on the browser version, plus they get tracking info they can sell.",negative
Don't force us to install the app to see the complete answers. There are cases where we use our phones to access Quora instead of the desktop in case of emergency. Keep it simple. Don't push it down our throats.,negative
"i don't know if the developers have just given up or turned it over to people who don't care, but the quality is slipping and the ""moderation"" is beyond ridiculous. The development of ""paying people per question asked"" has turned it in to a 3rd grade experiment. The same question asked 30 times with one or two words changed is destroying integrity. Automatic moderation that has bots looking for key words and phrases destroys a lot of appropriate content.",negative
"The app is mostly fine, however, external links to quora sometimes do not work correctly (they always work in chrome). Unfortunately, the app forces all external links to eventually go through the app, so in some cases cannot get to the content I actually want to read.",negative
"I don't want your stupid app, maybe if it wasnt forced upon me I may have downloaded it, my data is slow and I cant download apps so i came down to my friends house to get wifi just to download this app, write a bad review, and delete it.",negative
"I was reading a article on the website and right in the middle of read it, I was FORCED to download the app if i wanted to to continue reading. Did that and against my better judgement. And low and behold I couldn't get back to said article to finish it. In my book that's sheisty as all get out. What a horrible business model you have and as far as that, I don't like being forced to do anything. Now, I don't need Quora for reading or problem solving because there's threads everywhere.",negative
"It's really good app to gain knowledge and have a opinion, ethics of experts. I would recommend to use this app rather than using other useless app. In addition quora added some Indian language like Marathi,hindi,bangali etc so have it and explore your life better way.",positive
"What is it with the new glitch in quora where I can't view any image in the app, be it the author's profile photo or the images used in the answers or even of the ads. Please correct this glitch!",negative
"The ""Google"" you use when you're looking to learn something rather than wanting to buy something. Loves it!",positive
"i enjoyed reading articles on Quora,learning differences around the world and understand it through different peoples opinion,everything is real.",positive
Forced updates aate highly frustrating. Very heavy interface - takes forever to load. One of the worst made apps of a very good product.,negative
The images in answers just disappear as soon as i open it. None of the images are visible in answers. i tried reinstalling the app. But the issue remains the same,negative
"I've been using this app since 2018 and I really like it, many improvement through out the year and the community is really great But recently the ad is increasing as it's barraging through my feed (related/unrelated) I get it you guys want to earn money but find some other way to cooperate. Thank you",positive
"As someone who used the app then deleted it, I just wanted to report that this is the first site to actually make a pop up that BLOCKS your use of the site in a mobile browser to make you use the app. The app wasn't amazing anyway, but I'm thoroughly annoyed at being rendered unable to choose. Sorry, developers, it's not really your fault.",negative
"Excellent place to Learn, Unlearn & RElearn (LURE). Enjoying my bit of learning and sharing insights with objective of EnrichWealthWisdom.",positive
older apps dont work and require update to work. why? this is a just forum type app. thats too much hassle. especially on older hardware. never force updates unless security critical.,negative
"Even though my internet connection is working perfectly, the app shows no internet ! Sent from my OnePlus 7.",negative
I have become smarter since I started using quora. The fact that answers come from several sources help expands the knowledge base and gives perspective to questions,positive
you just got down from 5star to 1star because you just made me install the app in mid of my article which i was reading... and why the f##k you want us to install the app when we are quite happy with the crome web page,negative
I have been forced to install this application from the browser version. I don't use it and don't know if it's good. But the good thing is that people forced to install it can easily give it one star in protest. Thus it can get millions of one stars.,negative
"it gives me lot of information, ideas, unknown news & it was very much useful & exciting",positive
Forced to download or else it wouldnt let me read an article from the website. Annoying. Downloaded the app just to write this rating.,negative
I am giving one star for now... images take forever to load even though I have 10mbps connection... its annoying as hell... please fix it images shouldn't takr this much time...if you guys fix this officially i have no problem giving 5 star this community has awesome content,negative
Forced to install the app while i was reading the article without installing it couldn't read the article. Pathetic marketing strategy,negative
"I don't know, lately I am facing a lot of problems in viewing an image whether it is a profile picture or just an image attatched with an answer. I have access to 4G internet service and everything else works fine. Am I the only one facing this problem? Can anyone look into this?",negative
I am not going to get your app and don't force me I just going to use it in the chrome or any other browser. I will use it in browser and never gonna download your app.,negative
New version is much more stable and doesn't drain my battery. Raise to five star.,positive
Very informative and educative. Improved information and delivery.,positive
"I have to say I agree with the person who said halfway through the article, that she was forced to install the app to finish the article. I also came across that problem. I don't see why we have to be forced into having an app, which I don't have enough space left on my phone to do that. It is really frustrating. So I don't understand why you even send us emails. I certainly would appreciate it, IF you fixed the PROBLEM OF MAKING US INSTALL THE APP. I don't have room on my phone to install APP.",negative
"Earlier I thought It's a must have app. But then it started consuming a lot of my data. So, I switched back to webpage. But now, its frustrating to get ""download app"" popup midway while reading an article. Hence, changing me stars from 5 to 1. Why forcing your user to install an app if he is satisfied with your webpage?? Why you want to use more of the users data??",negative
"Quora is a good platform and a great idea, however, I am giving it one star for two reasons. Firstly, the website forces you to download the app. Once you start reading the response to a question, you get a popup that you cannot dismiss from a mobile browser. Secondly, the entire community has a staunch, extremely liberal bias. A little goes a long way, guys. Seriously, it's like you run a support group for people with terminal cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome instead of a social network.",positive
"I am satisfied with the Chrome version of Quora. Why the hell you guys force us to install the app. The app isn't even as good as the web version, the pictures don't get loaded and much more troubles.",negative
"forced to download to finishing reading something I wanted an answer to, could have chose a other link, but chose this one. Guess they think they have all the answers. going g to uninstall as soon as I finish this.",negative
App UI and UX is good overall. But I would request the developers to add dark mode. Thanks,positive
Why quora website has an issue when I'm reading on mobile browse... Why popup comes to download the App and it can't be cancelled... please solve this.,negative
"So bloody annoying, I was reading something on the browser version and it popped up telling me to get the app, I couldn't get rid of the pop up and lost the answer I was reading, wound me up to no end",negative
"Brilliant App for bringing people closer together, some use Aliases so that they can relate more to embarrassing situations or very personal experiences, I know a friend who formed a loving relationship entirely due to conversations on here, her comments were that it was superior to dating websites.",positive
"i really like the way its set up, it's easy to read & just have always liked the quora keeps the classifications all together..",positive
"Quora is very very useful platform to get knowledge about anything.. I'm giving 4 star because sometimes it's don't give option to copy an answer.. I wish that quora will launch ""Dark theme"" very soon..",positive
"Quora is a depository of knowledge. It is a cache of information from many sources, brought together by its members and freely offered to those who desire enlightenment, affirmation, understanding, clarity, & a second opinion. It is a record of the mindset of a vastly changing society. The current trends as well as a reminder of yesterdays. It is composed of milestones of the living as well as some who have departed. Its also a means for the dead to continue to teach us through their writings.",neutral
I'm learning alot of new stuff on quora... i honestly prefer this kind of environment as compared to other social media platforms,positive
"one of the best apps avsliable for readers and information seekers, full of interesting people, stories, and information.",positive
It is the best app to read interesting content and can learn a lot..,positive
Extremely useful app with tons of good advice and wonderful facts/questions/answers. I'm a writer and this app has been very helpful. There's always room for improvement though.,positive
"I had been using Quora since 2014. Sadly, this platform is nowhere near the level it was a few years ago. It's nothing more than a breeding ground for right-wing, conservative pseudo-nationalist and pseudo-patriots. Whatever little space was left has been occupied by worthless screenshots (for some reason) and memes.",negative
"a bit laggy and slow but still helps me to stay in touch with all the requests made in my name to answer to those questions asked by the largest global community. I wish to have an app that does not die on me so often, please do something. Every time I click submit this silly app stops working amd later I see my recent answer saved as a draft, ugh!",negative
"I've learned so much about the topics I'm interested in, from people who've been there, done that, know the real truth...very informative and interesting!",positive
"Access to global connections, yet full of individual and personal flavours, ideas sharing etc make Quora a hub, homelike, and a great space.",positive
"I was forced to download this app in the middle of a (rare) great answer because Quora won't let you finish reading it in Chrome. It was a pain to find the answer and pick up where I was made to leave off at. Forcing the little people to do what the Authoritarian elites tell them is fitting of the mindset the majority of writers at Quora have.You will learn this after reading a few of their so called ""answers"".",negative
forcing people to download the app and not allowing to read on browser. there is no way to dismiss the pop-up window which says download the app. even clicking on i have the app doesn't dismiss the window.,negative
"useful site, didnt want to download. When using the mobile site, quora forces you to download in the middle of an article. i dont have enough room and will absolutely delete it later. Im pretty tired of dealing with this. u can have 3 more stars if you fix your site :)",negative
"Dont get me wrong. It has some cool stories and people with advice, but a lot of the questions are just stupid and made up to inflate content. You could answer 9 of 10 of the physics questions with the discovery channel. Also if you look into money, there are a lot of people selling there ponzy scemes and self help books. A lot of professional wrighters doing what a lot of them do best which is give you false information that sounds good, for self gain.",negative
Great community but worst app and worst developers. I forgot my password they kept on bringing squares and I kept clicking on them and nothing happened. Worst developers.,negative
"I installed this app just for the sake of writing my review. Why I am being compelled to install the app, however good it may be, while going through an article YOU sent by email without MY request? Several others have shouted before me but you don't seem to care. I am immediately uninstalling and shall find other places to find the information needed.",negative
i was forced midway while reading an article to download the app. but it is a nice app.,positive
Forces me to download the app. I think this is where I stop using Quora as I believe it should allow me to use my mobile browser instead. I couldn't care less about downloading the app.,negative
Very inconvenient to work with Outlook - it opens inside of Outlook and doesn't work well there.,negative
I unsubscribed a while back. I am still getting notifications. I do not want them. Please do not send anymore. Thank you!,negative
it's a great app. but give us option to write a line or two elaborating the points if we report any post. i wanted to report a post because it was using fake pictures but the reporting options were limited.,positive
Like others I am here to say that forcing the installation of the app with uncloseable pop-ups is totally out of line and I refuse to download it at this point even if I wanted it.,negative
Always there is problem connecting to internet . I can rate with same net at same time but app can't connect to internet. Please fix this issue.,negative
Nice app. I love using this and I like spending time on this plateform as this is very informative.,positive
"Ironically , The platform that is built on the idea of 'be nice be respectful' is least respectful and considerate while forcing users to download the app . The website works perfectly fine for me . I don't need quora to remind me every few minutes that i should download the app.",negative
one of the greatest social media apps I have ever used. and i don't know where to begin i mean there is no cyberbullying not that i have seen and so many great experiences from many great people and daily life question i just cant say anything bad about it,positive
The application does not seem to get cleared in background processes. after some time it stops to load.,negative
I was going through my old emails and seen all these Quora emails. I opened one up and apparently I've been subscribed to them since 2017 around. They have good content. I'm glad I didnt mark them as spam.,positive
"I love this app most, of all the apps in my phone. only one thing i wanted to suggest as improvement is the reading history which help us to reread the answers without typing the same questions.",positive
the experience is simply awesome.you can get the perfect answer of any question.,positive
"was forced to download the app, we are already content with the web version , no one need more app to consume limited resources, for this autocratic approach , u get 1 star",neutral
"At times, the algorithm doesn't work effectively. There are times when good answers do not get circulated enough.",negative
"too many ridiculous questions. I used to really like answering questions on quora, but now they are paying people, including me, to ask questions. so now we are getting an incredible amount of ridiculous questions, such as if 2x=8, what is x. it's no fun anymore.",negative
I enjoy using this app!! Especially when I'm bored laying in bed at night. its entertaining being on the and self all the questions asked and the answers to them. You will get your questioned answered usually within a day if not sooner! It doesn't take long for you to get an answer to your questions! I reccomend this app if you're looking for something like this one! It wouldn't be a wasted download I'm pretty sure you will keep this one on your phone for a while!,positive
you guys can update yourself by using this regularly. you get useful information for respective course. but you should have Patience to read the answers.,positive
"crashing even after update. if i want to read any answer on browser, it doesn't allow. and directs to app, which crashes.",negative
"i didn't want to download the app, but I was forced to by the mobile site. The app works fine, but it's worse than than the website",negative
"The android app stutters, stalls, and randomly restarts during use. It is the most unreliable app on my phone. The content is excellent, though, so do yourself a favor and just use the Web version - which has more a intuitive interface anyway.",negative
"No problems thus far. 4 stars only bc I'm not savvy to the whole app/experience yet. Still learning and frankly it would go quicker with a tutorial or two to clear up some navigation and versatility (ie. options) humps I've encountered. It's a great app and forum, I just need a better grip on the apps capabilities. um, help.",positive
"It has been an excellent journey with Quora so far. I had never thought I'd love this platform so much. If a part of you want to learn something, it's a must have app. It's pinned on my home screen.",positive
"Forced install added into an already fully functioning browser supported application will always leave a bad taste in my mouth. not to mention the app is comparably riddled with bugs. id like to believe that this is overall a good thing for the quality of the experience with quora, but for the time being i dont appreciate being forced into downloads which overall reduce the quality of my experience. even reddit doesn't force you to download and most people use the app regardless if its on mobile",negative
"Barring the occasional grammatical error and a tendency to encourage bland writing, this is a good and useful app!",positive
"It would be great if i could continue reading without having to downlaod the app, even if i press ""i already have the app"" it just makes me download it anyways.",positive
I think you should add an option to sort the answers by the date of upload. Most answers becomes irrelevent with time.,neutral
"Mobile application shows error 429 which is not acceptable for me, I opened website and it says that I'm a web scrapper. Application is slow and clumsy. It is not native and looks like a webview.",negative
The concept is great but after the recent update it is not letting me type answers smoothly. Every time I type to write an answer it hangs in between. Now the app doesn't open,negative
Somehow in some magical way ..most of my post dont get veiws past 10k..... 1.5 day 16k veiws...then stopped..on other...1 week 10k....then stopped...as in none of the two post were and most of old one weren't watched by literally anyone in past 3 weeks. In all great app ... great place.,neutral
Very nice app and very helpful also for every one For Every question there is a clear information.,positive
It seems like the app is being forced on me. I should enjoy the liberty to choose to read quora contents on browser but not be forced to read on the quora app.,negative
this app is good but when I was reading an article online it forced to me install this app saying for a better user experience but thos is all for revenue. As they could have suggested to download and not forced to.,negative
"I've been using quora now for more than 5 years now, still the full white blasting UI. My eyes are hurting. Can you please give us dark mode?",negative
"Though, I have started using it few days ago. Its a great platform to share views by answering questions. I am still exploring this app each day and already started liking it. I would suggest you to download this app as it can help you with different skills and indeed, keeps you well informed.",positive
I installed this app only to leave a bad review (then uninstalled). Stop forcing me to download the app to be able to use the browser version on my phone! It's not cool! Absolutely terrible design decision!,negative
No problems when I open the app and it is easy to use. Highly recommended to those who want to know more about the world because it covers like most of the topics.,positive
"Best app ever, Thanks to the developers üòÑ‚ù§‚ù§ I've always searched for a similar app that makes everything possible, asking questions and getting quick answers on any topic you can imagine! Was so excited when I installed it and still am üëèüëèüëè",positive

Informative. i like it very much. i request quora to develop Enabling dark mode option to make it more convenient for reading.,positive
"Very enjoyable, opens the door to debate, knowledge and memory. Plus it's a lot of fun!",positive
Was surfing quora from chrome on mobile when their web forced me to download app. I downloaded it to give 1 star and now I would happily uninstall.,negative
"Can you please add read out loud feature ?? Sometimes the answers are lengthy and holding mobiles become hectic. So an audio of the answer will be a great thing for all of us üòäüòä Thank you, waiting for your postive reply and update",positive
I'd recommend this app for anyone that loves to read and learn. It provides everyone with the opportunity to read ample life time experiences from users around the world. I've learnt a lot on quora just by reading the life experiences of people from different works of life. There's a lot of knowledge here. So much to wear you out. Just choose the ones most relevant to you at the moment...,positive
"it was good till ads were not present,option to disable them should be provided. yet super app",positive
"the app is slow,laggy n so buggy. and after the update it doesnt load any anything and shows android system webview has crashed. and it's worst when access it from chrome it forces me to install application.",negative
i believe its a good tool for opening up from the draw in operational thinking and canned worms of thought that is waxed stale from directional subversity for their desire to gain power in wrongful structuring.,neutral
"I prefer the experience browsing quora in a web browser, but a pop up appears in the middle of an article forcing me to download the app to continue. I don't want to clutter my phone with single use apps. Please provide people with the option to use your website.",negative
"it is crashing repeatedly. not able to use browser. it is asking me to use app. either way, I'm not able to use. earlier it was working fine. suddenly starting to crash.",negative
I hate quora..... As it forces me to insta its app even when i am comfortable reading it on chrome. Why force? You can provide an option to download..... Downloading or not it is our choice. I have logged i there and that should be fair enough for you.,negative
1 star coz you are forcing me to install this app to read the content which I was easily reading on browser. I don't want your app.,negative
You ll have to search for topics that you follow.Quora always show some recommendations and never lets you follow your topic easily.Why..? you should ideally be showing 'Recommended for you' in a separate page...,negative
Each update is making the app slower. images are not loading quickly..but otherwise good app,negative
one of the most useful app in day to day life to know various facts and the best thing is dat sharing of experiences in every field ..,positive
"The app is wonderful very informative the only drawback is that it is very data heavy due to the ads, but i understand this you still need to make money. The reason i am giving such a poor rating i beacue of the web site that keeps kicking me to the Google play store to download the app which i dont want, so until you fix that this review will stay. I use the web site because it uses less data then the app arrange but true.",positive
I do not want your App stop pushing it on me. I just want to read and answer from my email. I should not be forced to Dl this App to read a few stories,negative
"This was a forced install so that you can continue reading. Once downloaded, the app flashed and then darkness. When I finally got into the app, couldn't even find the question I was reading...I didnt delete right away but when I used my phone after the forced install, it would suddenly black out. I did not have this problem before? I removed app and now my phone appears to be back to normal. Don't force us to download your app if its not even that great.",negative
It's wholesome. But there is an issue I'm facing. Photos aren't opening properly .It opens and then disappear. What could be the reason? My net speed is fine and my phone storage is also ok.,negative
Good platform but excessive tracking of data and forcing me to install the app is a huge downside. Terribe.,negative
"kind of broken. everytime I try to go and read some of the answers, it opens the app and tells me that there is no stories in my feed. it's been like that for a couple weeks already. I had to uninstall it to be able to read anything",negative
good app for sharing their hidden problems and also it can help many ways. some scientific information also good,positive
I enjoy using this app because I feel like I am learning. It rarely freezes or crashes.,positive
"it was great at first, but the ads are way too many now, that its hard to differentiate between real quora content and ads... it's made in a disrespectful way to the user",negative
"whenever I search anything on Google, each and every time the quora gives right and useful information. I like it and that's very nice.",positive

"I didn't want this app. I just wanted to read Quora in my browser, but there is this popup that tells you to install the app and there is no way to close the popup and continue reading Quora in the browser. Please tell me why. Edit: deleted my Quora account",negative
Forced install. The experience on a browser is perfectly fine but they FORCE you to install their app by not letting you finish what you were reading halfway through. Deserved 1 star from all my 3 accounts.,negative
Good forum to explore sometimes conflicting views and encounter interesting experiences. One problem: I can no longer get it on my email. My email server says it is not their problem and I cannot find a way to reach a Quora administrator.,negative
"I have downloaded this app just to be able to leave a review at how obnoxious the website itself is. At every turn as I tempted to read a story I got a pop up I could not close that prevents me from reading telling me to ""download the free app"" and any attempt to backtrack would result in me losing the story I was attempting to read. Quora seems to be one of those companies that do not grasp that one features are forced upon users or are spamd with pop ups that it antagonize has users. Scam.",negative
"Forced app. When you read Quora, a pop up window asks you to install this app. No matter what you choose, the original thread you have been reading closes and you lose the story. I would give it zero stars for this if I could.",negative

Overall the app is good and informative but I used to get too much anonymously answer which has explicit and obscene content.,negative
"A very awesome place. Herr you can share your knowledge and receive a lot of it. There are many stories that hace had a great influence on me, that i came to know from this awesome app. The fact thats it allows you to answer any questions its really good.

"I like Quora(not the app), I downloaded it and it was working fine, but now I can't open the app because it's crashing every time I open it and also I can't read complete articles and experiences shared on Quora because Quora limits readers access to information on their website, so it being a useful portal yet rendered useless for me.

"Hey Quora, 1 star for you. Yes, I use smartphone for my personal development. One of the biggest trick to avoid being smartphone zombie (or unsmart zombie) is to avoid installing apps and social media. You see how they break the very harmony of our daily life? and addict us? Whoever (greedy bas*ard) in your company decided to force the app to force revenue, can take my review up his ass!",neutral

You are eventually met with a popup that monopolizes your screen and has you select one of two choices. 1. To go and download the Quora app. 2. No thanks Ihave the app. However if you select the latter. You will be taken to the play store for the quora app and if you select the first you will be taken to the play store.",negative
Damnit!!!!!! Quora just removed the bookmark icon from the app along with their website. I can't find it anywhere. Just bring it back.,negative
Unable to read answers when querying on a topic using search bar. Your UI is making it hard for me to be a regular quora user. Get your act together.,negative
Definitely an effective platform for sharing the knowledge and experience. Some of the questions are practical difficulties while many are doubts of maginaly acquainted (rather innocent) people . Those responding to the qieries have to assess that before answering . This way it's really a open platform . On every reading you will know something new that was missing. I enjoy reading this and contributing in my area of activities.,positive
"The webb version is completely fine Quora. Why are you harrasing your users to download something that they actually never need? If I'm a quora regular surley I would have delighted to get a reminder to use the app, because that makes sense. Like on Medium. But this? Forcing people to download an app to read the page they were already reading? Stop. Just stop it.",neutral
It's an wonderful app for people who want to share and learn from experiences to facts even a little fiction. don't wait download now I'm sure it's what your looking for.,positive
"The experience is just terrible on the app. The browser virsion is much much better. It keeps lagging, doesn't response to my touches and an error of some kind every single day. Looks like the developers don't care for the app.",negative
"so upset because while i was in the middle of reading a nice big ad comes up and blocks the screen, you cant go around it or anything. you have two options to either download the app or say you already have it. either way it takes you to the play store and away from what you were reading and sometimes you can never find them again. worst thing ever!!!!!!!",negative
"Two things that Quora should focus on- 1. In-appropriate content keeps showing even after ""Not Allowing"" it in Settings. 2. For all the Bed-time readers, ""Night-Mode"" feature will be very much required and will be helpful. -that's for now, I like the app.",neutral

"Used to be a good platform. But requiring everyone to login JUST TO READ responses is ridiculous. And a shady practice. Probably data mining. And BEHAVIOR MINING. Too much of a pain. I NO LONGER CONTRIBUTE, or READ, for this reason alone. Many great contributors have left for this same Control Freak and User UNFRIENDLY policy. Hence their platform suffers. Better content is available from More User Friendly Sites. I don't even open links to Quora anymore. Even from Google searches.",negative
i started to install a couple times and instead deleted it. greedy stupids would make you select multiple catagories. maybe though they are just greedy. i do use their web version and reconmend it.,negative
i was forced to download the app as i open quoraa on web. instead of this you should give a suggestion mesaage to the users that you can also check on quira app. otherwise it is a good app. one star is because of this irritating problem,negative
It's getting harder wade through all the dumb repetitive questions. The app freezes a lot. You click on something & something else pops up. It's getting boring.,negative
THIS APP MAKES TIME WASTING & IRRITATING LANGUAGE ASSUMPTIONS.I JUST BECAUSE I LIVE IN MEX. & THEREFORE USE A MEX. I.S.P. DOESN'T MEAN I PREFER SPANISH.STOP RAMMING ONE PARTICULAR LANGUAGE UP MY SMARTPHONES ASS. I THINK YOU I think you have plenty of indications of the language I prefer the internet was idealized as giving a choice .GO FIGURE,negative
i love it. i can both ask and ans w er questions. it is very eclectic and unpredictable and i love the ramdoness.,positive
"I was forced to download this app by the Quora website, which won't let me scroll past just the one article I just read, without asking me to ""open in app"" or ""download the app"".",negative
Great app. The app has given me lots of information about so many things I have searched for many different times. I will keep going to quora for reliable information. It is an awasome app.,positive
Deliberately built to annoy any user. And most times the answers are not reliable. The process of weeding out incorrect answers does not work aggressively enough.,negative
You didn't allow me to read without downloading the app. So I downloaded this app and immediately uninstalled it just to make sure you get a 1 star rating.,negative
very slow app. please improve it. even on wifi it's opening at a low speed.,negative
Good app for any article and news search. Helped me lot with the truth and false things of reality.,positive
it is super. for me as a student it is very good and it is very easy to find the answers when the teachers gives assignment or any homework,positive
Forced to download the app to finish reading the article I was reading in my browser. That's an insanely aggressive marketing tactic and whoever came up with it should not be in this job. I downloaded it just so I could leave this review. Never using quora for anything ever again.,negative
"best aap for knowledge point of view, most exiting is that person sharing their own experience but only one thing is not good that is you not find your answer suddenly for this you have to wait maybe for a days or month",negative
I don't like this app. It doesn't work like it should. When your reading a story it takes you to another page and when it is supposed to go back to the same spot it rarely does. Needs a scroll function that actually allows you to read articles that way.,negative
"I enjoyed using this app, until I got permanetly banned for not naming my profile my real name. Now that I used up three chances to change my profile name to my REAL name, I can't change it after those three tries. I'm not allowed to post or respond to post just becuase of a name policy. Thanks, now I have to make a new account just to ask questions. I want to ask, why do you have to make it a perament banning, it isn't like i have done anything malicious. Please belp me in some way. thank you.",negative
best app ever i used once you select your preference it shows amazing content of your choice.,positive
"since I have been downloaded it, everytime I open it, it get crashed. Showing error notification -cleartext not permitted.",negative
As a webste it's great but the android version has tested my balls of patience and it's UI is just horrible also quora needs some adjustments in the modernising otherwise I fear that we will lose another great concept.,negative
"fall in love with this app. It helps me a lot in publishing posts without having an own website. Even it improved my writing and communication skills. You can pick up any type of questions and answer them at your own pace. It's free after all !!!! And It's worth for giving a 5 star rating. Love you quora team for your hard work and support. Thank you,",positive
"I Have an issue that this app consumes too much data pack .If you read 5 to 10 post , Your 100 Mb mb data is used up.It even consumes more data that Youtube app .Kindly resolve this issue and make it consumes less data pack.If this is resolved soon in your upcoming update I will definitely rate you 5 star",negative
"I am in the browser, i am trying to read a quora article. there is a pop up ad suggesting i get the app with two options. 1 download the app 2 select that you already have the app. there is no close ad option. if you select download it links navigates to play store. if you select that you already have it, it *also* navigates to play store. there is no close button. if you tap back it closes the ad but also leaves the article. i will not be forced to download the app. Always liked them before...",neutral
beneficial app to gain knowledge and increase the power of thinking through reading answer of best writers among the world. Certainly helps to connect with the multilateral minds.,positive
My question is why quora made the mobile website when i'm forced to use mobile app. is this not something called own-profit. Quora is not thinking about user but about money and own benefits. I was reading article but suddenly was forced to download app but my network speed was slow so i can't download app. please make alert dismissaable otherwise you will loose users..,negative
"forced to download the app, like others. I wish app developers would stop doing this, not only is it frustrating, it's also inconvenient üòëüëè",negative
"informative. helped me a lot. this ""rate the app"" notif was popping up a lot many times, so u might find my feedback very boring and NOT HELPFUL. But yes this app is helpful.",positive
"why is information not provided by developer? because something to hide and you don't want users to know about it.. At least have the normal human decency to tell users what is being updated and what is changed.. Any application that does this loses me I don't care how good the Application is or useful.. If I'm going to put your application on my phone I expect to know what the update is about.. People we need to complain to Google to stop this happening, you never know what this update is.",negative
interesting place to spend time with at least some useful knowledge being gained or passed on.,positive
"When I needed Quora it betrayed me. Opened Chrome and tried like 5-7 times everytime prompted Gateway Error. Then downloaded the Quora app from the Play Store, same thing Gateway Error. From the past 30 mins I'm getting the same error over and over and I'm fed up now that's why gave 1 star. Update: Quora now forces to use it's app and doesn't let view complete answers on the browser. Uttei disappointed.",negative
"I was FORCED to download this I was just browsing Quora on Chrome, and then comes this dialogue box, I can't scroll any further till I download the Quora app. There is no button to close the dialogue box. No matter what you tap, you will be redirected to Quora's Play Store page. This is absoultely unethical that I'm being forced to download and use the app when I'm perfectly fine with the browser version. Truly disappointed.",negative
"When I open the app, I get ERR-CLRTEXTNOTPERMITTED and yep, that's about it. Can't use quora from the site because it directs you to the app. Looks like it's time to find a new place to unwind.",negative
That one star is too much considering I was strongarmed into downloading the stupid app. I try to bypass the downloading options while completing reading my story but I end up with the same option every time which is to download the app. This is really ridiculous,negative
"It is a great app for knowledge gaining and sharing. Well be judgemental about what you read, don't blindly believe everything you read. To developers: It would be great to include a dark theme into Quora. As it is a text reading platform and most of the screens is basically whit in colour this drains batteries more. I can assume by introducing black theme on quora on an average you can save battery consumed by quora about 30%. Its just prediction and might be saved more on an AMOLED disiplay.",positive
"unnable to open,, it is showing"" try again network problem"" even though my net is high. I can open and run other apps which run through internet, but I can't open this app. do something",negative
Garbage trying to make you download the app constantly. Done with site and app now because of it.,negative
Pissed!!! Am really pissed....After the last update my quora is crashing...Then I thought this update would solve it...This is also crashing.. uninstalling this,negative
"While the app ""works,"" the website is way better. Every time you want to see an answer from the home page, it has to load again even though it loaded on the home page. While this is ok for people with good internet or data plans, I have been in India for vacation and my Intl. plan gives me up to 2G speeds; this makes using the app a pain. There are also times where an answer will load but when you click on it, the whole app unloads saying there isn't enough internet available. Use the website.",neutral
"Rubbish app. Why rubbish? 1.Once in web browser, in the middle of reading something in quora, it forces you to switch to app and then start reading once again. 2. Can't open multiple tabs neither in browser nor app. 3. Never commented, never did anything but reading, but today it blocked me from starting a new topic. 4. Very hard to complete profile. Stucks on credentials.",negative
"Great app but NEEDS a Dark Mode. The app looks clean and modern and it's animations are smooth. I am very pleased with the app, but I strongly suggest a Dark Mode on this app as it will provide many benefits to users.",positive
"Stop forcing me to download the app. The website is far better, you idiots. Pictures don't load in the app properly. App feels laggy.",negative
"User Interface is just unbearable. Every other post on the feed is either an ad or a sponsored post, and everytime you click on a question in hopes of seeing the replies, you'll get a splitting headache instead. Ads, sponsored posts, related posts, scattered along the screen like an unsolved 2500-piece puzzle, and you'll most likely end up wondering where the answers are because oh dear the whole thing is just a mess. If you care about your wellbeing, please avoid this hell of an app. Trust me.",negative
"I don't want this app. If you want to advertise the app, fine. But don't force me to download it by blocking the screen with a pop-up. Not epic.",negative
deducting the rating because almost eveey second time this app crashes and I have to reboot my phone.,negative
I dont see any reason to use app Chrome version of quora was fine for me I mean I've been using quora for 4 years without any problem i dont want to switch.,neutral
It just keeps banning me cause I am spamming even though am answering questions just quick. And I can't even find a place to appeal. Really bad.,negative
its a best app to stay touch with all the current affairs. no other app can compare with #Quora. I suggest you all to please download this app. its a great one. you can get simply answers for your questions with a deep mind setop. Thanks to #QuoraTeam for inventing this app. You guys are just awsome.,positive
"4 almost 5 before last update. Will change as soon as its fixed. I have a good device, internet speeds, but I can no longer view my followers, the top writers in topics, or any of the horizontal menu items except the first one now since the forced update. The titles will highlight but will never load to that page.",negative
Good business strategy. You are forcing me to download the application. What if someone has limited space in their phone then they will not get the chance to use quora. I am reading a topic and continuously you are asking me to download the application. And you didn't allow me to read the article in web version. You are forcing ! See you know very well I have almost no competitors in the market. So you think you can do anything. But surely people will leave you today or tomorrow.,negative
DO NOT install this app because they make it very difficult if you ever want to delete the app and get away from them. One of the biggest reasons you will want to get away from them is that they follow you onto other websites and gather up your data wherever you go on the internet.,negative
Whenever i read something on quora before even i finish up reading a pop up come and say that i can't read unless i install this stupid ass app keep on forcing to use this app so i ain't gonna visit your website sucker have a nice day,negative
"i don't like this app, too much ads and is a bloatware, they're blocking the webpage to to download the app.",negative
"the whole subject about narsisum has helped me so much about my estranged mother that now I can get on with my life. I always knew she was sick but for many years I blamed myself cause I never could live up to her expectations or was never good enough for her nor my children. Now I know and understand it wasn't me that had a problem, it was her. And there was nothing I could due to make her love me. It's ok with me now, my eyes are opened. Thank you Quora.",positive
Download the app just to give you 1 star. A Forced login is understandable but forced download of your app is in no way improving my reading experience.,negative
Questions are repeated alot. After a while things get boring from reading monotonous stuff.,negative
"The answers are location specific. I see all answers from only indians. Would be nice if answers from all over the world were displayed, it would really expand the perspective on the answer.",neutral
Too many ads... üòêüòê really irritating... Though it helps to find the best answers & informations,negative
"I enjoyed reading Quora but I refuse to be forced to download an app. When you stop trying to strong-arm people into downloading the app by placing an uncloseable window over the online feed maybe I'll change the rating. Until then so long , Quora.",negative
It is a nice platform for communicating and learning from all kinds of people and helps one to test knowledge of himself/herself by answering variety of questions of the topics you think you are good at.,positive
"Nice app. You can share and learn a lot about other people's lives, their experiences and knowledge. Also a nice platform to showcase your writing skills.",positive
"Your website sucks, and because you keep bugging me to download the app, I won't. Keep it up though. You drive away a lot of people with that policy, and staying away from Quora can only be good for people.",negative
I took latest and now it is crashing every time I try to open it. I am going to uninstall the app,negative
"everything is great, except when it comes to viewing anything when an upgrade is needed. it doesn't let me open the app until I upgrade it. why the f***",negative
"'Continue Reading' button doesn't expand an answer and instead redirects to top of page when clicked, until and unless all the content including the ads is loaded (which has no indication). Bad experience.",negative
You guys have ruined the experience of Quora. Why are you forcing me to download the app? I like the Web version of Qoura more than the app because it is faster than the app. It takes too much time to open answers in the app. So please don't destroy the experience,negative
very gd forum where anyone can get an answer to any matter that was bugging them through crowd funding or rather crowd finding where the cried chips in with whatever is usually the right answer. It Has worked well so far and will probably do as well in the future too... Hats off to them on the same,positive
"3 starts because I like the content of this platform,but forcing people to download the app so that they can continue reading is ridiculous. We do understand that it might be necessary to sign up, which most of us would have done, but forcing to download the app is VERY annoying! Would have given it one star if I didn't like the content.",negative
"Came up with a pop up that every time I managed to close, as soon as it closed it would take me back to top of the page, and after 4/5 attempts and going very slowly I was able to inch down the page, read the answer without a pop up. I've downloaded the app so that doesn't happen again. And that's being forced into doing something. You realise that? Now you can say to the advertiser's that the app receives tonnes of downloads. Are you telling them it's just so we can leave bad reviews??????",neutral
"i love this app.....through this i got to know so many different things as well as different people and their different views and perceptions over a particular topic.....it's truly a platform to enchance your knowledge futhermore, an individual can select the topics h/she interested in to read and write about. i love to be a quoran :) #leaving a bit sparkle everywhere i go through writing. PARDEEP RANDHAWA. A keen observer (quora bio) innocent wink ;)",positive
forcefully asking to download the app when I am reading something important and after installing I cant get the same answer...upgrade your app properly or else dont ask to install it forcefully...,negative
"I love what Quora is... But I HATE how confusing it is. Reading responses on my phone can get convoluted with all the other random questions. It's almost impossible for me to read a post's conversation. I also think submitting a question could be a little more intuitive, like submitting a question but have a space to add context. I could also be using it wrong, but I shouldn't have any difficulty, regardless haha.",negative
"Great app! Ask any question and give answer to any question! What could be better than it. A complete bunch of knowledge. Happy to use it but just one suggestion, please develope Dark mode/Night mode so that it would be more easy to use it in night as well as in day!",positive
"Wonderful platform. The topics are sensible and the contributors are sane, insightful and respectful. I've never been on a better social and networking platform. Keep it up!!!",positive
"vary useful app in knowing the trend and gathering true information.. if someone wants to be updated regarding business, politics, education, stock markets, philosophy, and information regarding medical & literature science nd so on.... then it would be the great platform for him.....use it by your way cz it's so useful",positive
"This is one of the greatest joys of my life. The overwhelming majority of my free time is spent here doing what I love, and I strongly recommend Quora for anyone who has a question they want to have answered or wants to see what other people think. Quora is a treasure of our time, and will be appreciated and emulated for decades to come. It is a superb time capsule, and all points of view from many societies are represented within.",positive

You bastards are forcing us to download the app even when we don't want. Can't use from the Google Chrome.,negative
Very informative. The topic I am most interested in is frequently and thoroughly discussed. I've had more information and insight from this app. than all counseling sessions combined.,positive
"It's useful and sometimes I really love the information people posts on it but I wanna tell something really bad about it's website , it forces to download the app and this Dusturbs when someone reads something and one more thing ( jab iski website pr disturbance hoti h to esi gaaliyaan Aatin h jo Bhut hard h (chutiya)).",negative
"I love Quora, so much so, I have to be careful when I use it because I get absorbed into the feed and forget everything. My partner jokingly claims to be single while I'm on it. App design is clean and nice. Not sure if it has a dark mode, will check later, but if it doesn't, consider its addition, reading on a white background is horrid.",positive
"If there were state-controlled apps, Quora would be the standard bearer. You can only move in a preset direction and there's no such thing as ""save my spot."" Forget picking up where you left off! I've decided the developers are playing one big mind game manipulating users. Control freaks!",negative
"That was kind of a low down move. Reel me in with situations similar to mine, but just as i feel as though i am about to learn something that might help, you force me to download the app.",negative
"Well before I thought it was an amazing site, but now I hate it. I was forced to download its app. It was fine and useful before. I was simply reading about something and boom, I'm being forced to download it. It's stupid. Now it's taking up all my space on my phone when I could simply just look it up on the internet. Well good job Quora, you just lost a loyal follower. I dont reccomend this app. Don't waste your time. Just find answers somewhere else. Stupid Quora.",negative
You forced me to download the app with unavoidable pop up. Can't you allow us to simply browse on a phone browser? That's why downloaded it to give 1 üåü and uninstalled üòÅ‚úå FO now.,negative
"I believe it's just another App to collect information about the user. In addition, why is it not possible to delete one's account, after having signed up ? There are no options in ""Settings"", for this purpose. Best Regards From The Bad Doctor.",negative
great app for curious people. If you love learning new stuff specially in the academic field. This app will be ideal.,positive
This app did not have answers for electronic and telecommunications it show about electrical .it is underrating app. I don't want to give a single star. but it will not post without a star,negative
"Tyring to read an article when a pop up, which cant be removed, displayed asking if i want to download the app. Not when im reading something i don't!! But i have to back out and reload the site, the question i was reading has gone and been replaced. Just about to sign out and forget about Quora.",negative
Downloaded this because I was forced to in order to read an article on a mobile device. What a nonsense.,negative
"Used to work brilliantly. This morning my phone had a spontaneous aneurysm and died. So I got a new phone, and Quora doesn't work on the new one. Did Quora kill my old phone? I don't know. All I know is that every other app I have works perfectly, and Quora doesn't work at all. Even though it was working fine yesterday.",negative
This app has helped me with countless things. It is amazing to have my questions answered by experts globally as well as to help people understand the things i know about.,positive
I don't understand why it doesn't allow to browse using chrome. I have decided to keep only apps that are of importance to make phone clean. even there is webpage developed for mobile it is requiring installation to view content. that's disgusting,negative
"you cannot voice your opinion honestly . if you write unbiased ,these people on the name of be nice policy , block your opinion . more over the ads are too much and app is 3rd rate . searching something is like finding a needel in haystack",negative
Not a fan of forcing people to install the application to consume or find a quick answer and to then ignore it. Like if wikipedia forced me to add a wiki app while reading that 1 article on that month. Ridiculous.,negative
"I would receive fun facts and stories from Quora in my email, so installed app. But while scrolling stories, WOW, had no idea they were so leftist. So if you are hard core blue pilled, all yours! NOT for me.",neutral
I don't like being forced to install apps. The web site worked just fine for me. I'm going to uninstall right after leaving this review.,negative
I love this app! If I'm looking for answers I always get them at Quora! And the opportunity to provide answers is awesome! Great app and a great experience!,positive
"Quora is so pushy; first I wasn't allowed to read the site without signing up-- so I did. Now I'm reading the site on my phone, and it forced me to download the app for me to continue reading. All my experiences with Quora have been irritating. Today is the last day I'm using it!",negative
"Awful.Horrible and worst app.Really I have to download your app now and the best part ""Forcefully"".Very cheap quora, and truely i must say this is you have become now "" Cheap"".",negative
I'm very much addicted to it. Feels good to answer questions and also to read different answers about diverse topics.,positive
Best ever app for gaining knowledge..... we can directly ask questions what we need and where we stuck... even we can help others by answering their problems... such a great app... loved it...,positive
THIS is a good application it gives us a lot of knowledge and insight of the world but to use it we have to sacrifice our privacy as without giving Google location access we cant open and also it automatically connects to our Google account without permission overall it's a good application,positive
"Forces me to download this app if I visit their site. Even when I click ""I already have this application"" it still sends me to the play store. Installed /rated and deleted",negative
"Quora is great, but I just wish all the buttons and options and navigation on the site were a bit more organized, properly labeled, and more intuitive because if they were, I'd use it much more often.",positive
Forced to use the app. I installed the app just so I could leave a bad - and well deserved - review. Trying to force me to install a stupid app just to read a damn response? And even worse: I was halfway through. This is wrong on so many levels. To whatever bonehead that runs Quora and thinks this kind of attitude will translate into growth to your platform: think again! It wont! I hope you go bankrupt asap.,negative
"After updating the app, This app is not working properly. After opening the post , image is not uploading in any post. kindly fix it. Otherwise i will uninstall it.",negative
"very useful app for all age people's, you can develope your contacts, knowledge, future vision, self analyze all in one place. Quora.",positive
forcing to install the app is totally annoying and also forcing to update the otherwise it won't open is ridiculous,negative
"Why quora does not have a dark or night mode, especially since its mainly an app for reading purpose. Please do the needful. Actually want to give it a 5 star but to get the attention of the developer doing so.",negative
"Amazing app every one should have this app. because this app gives the ans to almost all the questions, From good expert peoples or some how experienced peoples you will get ans to the questions, you can also contrubute your ans if you are experienced or have some knowledge in any domain. But o er all the app is amazing.",positive
"I like Quora itself, but forcing me to download an app to view half the content is, at best, extremely obnoxious and at worst, malicious. I prefer using web apps for a majority of online content and only using an app for services I use frequently enough that I would benefit from the increased speed of a native app.",negative
A very interesting app/site easy to understand responses are always given out to a particular question and always reliable.,positive
"a nice program to improve english in reading. I wish, the program can make us practice in listening.",positive
"Just trying to read on mobile browser and when scrolling down to read more of the stories, get an unclosable popup to 'download the app' or 'already have the app'. Whenever I tried to close it, it sent me back to my email as if saying 'Haha, you don't want the app? You don't get to continue reading, yah female dog!'. Very frustrating.",negative
Spent nearly 10 minutes waiting for the app to download which never happened. I have tried multiple times and it is stuck at 95% & the only reason I attempted to download the crappt app is because I can't read anything on the website without being told I have to use the app. Absolute bullcrap.,negative
I like the app but clicking on the answer and seeing a blank white screen instead of an image is really annoying. I have to manually click on the image and open it.,negative
"This company is obnoxious. I downloaded the app just so i can leave this review. After reading a answer and clicking on similar questions to see what others had to say, a pop up hijacked my browser and forced me to sign in to continue reading the answer. I thought, ok kinda annoying but ill go with it. Then, 5 questions later another pop up hijacking my device again demanding I download the app, I tried everything to close the pop up, as I dont want the app. Nope, you must download. Screw quora",negative
This app is awful. You are forced to follow 10 different interests out the gate and you have to disable every kind of notification email manually. The format of posting questions is awful and it's programmed so poorly that your phone will lag as you try to type because of the interface. Use a computer if you want to bother with this site.,negative
"Unreliable. Quora used to be great because the answers were coming from people who were supposedly experts in the subject. It has deteriorated into a fountain of misinformation from respondants with no formal background in the subjects but with a desire to be seen aa an expert in something. Also most of the questions seem to have been submitted by the person wanting to write an answer. Trite, inane, self serving, unverified, and many times, isuspect completely fabricated.",negative
My new favorite time waster..Love reading the stories!! Love the app still but it's not working properly. Buffers at the end of story and won't allow me to comment or upvote.,positive
"Sometimes, the app just closes on its will, when i was about to read an article, and the next thing i know, I cant find it! Thats really annoying. And PLEASE remove the install app thingy on your mobile website as people LOVE quora, and when in a friend's phone, u cant really use quora because u cant indtall the app, and neither can u read!",negative
"Forcing me to download the app so I could finish reading the article that you emailed me WAS A REALLY LOW BLOW!!! Not impressed with that at all. You should let us decide if we want yet another app on our phone, or prefer to read articles /questions in a browser... Or just do whatever we want to do. It's our phone, not yours! Stop treating us like children and let us decide. Not happy...",negative
"Was useing quora website fine then got a pop-up blocking me every time I viewed a set part of a post, telling me I had to install the app.",negative
What an annoying piece of junk trying to login.. I just won't play your stupid games trying to recover my password.. sort it for more üåü,negative

"It's good, but sometimes you find some unless things & they take to much time to remove these kind of things.",neutral
"App isn't responding...if I swipe down to refresh it is not loading...better to use quora on a web browser. Also, upvote and sharing on WhatsApp options aren't responding.",negative
The app does not have a dark mode. It is quite the struggle to use the app for prolonged periods of time without exausthing you eyes.,negative
No complaints here. The app works great and the push notifications are a nice touch.,positive
Not able to view in browser.. popup comes for downloading app which can't be skipped,negative
I didn't want to use the app due to the condition of my phone. Now i am forced to use it. The app is good. But why the website is always shows a msg to download the app. Very irritating,negative

"They forced me to download their app, so here you go! My opinion on such tactics for something I don't want. One star! Fully deserved. Now I'll uninstall.",negative
Forcing people to download the app so they can continue reading is really really ridicoulus.,negative
Instead of being able to finish what I was reading I get forced to use the app to continue. Except now I can't find what I was reading again! To top it off you can't use the stupid app until sign in with facebook or Google? I guess it's time to read somewhere else entirely. Uninstalling and not reading Quora anymore. Honestly don't know why anyone would rate this higher than one star.,negative
Don't want your app. I get emails that I can't read already. Will be unsubscribing from all.,negative
"A lovely platform where one can share their views, get valuable advices, suggestions and much more.",positive

"I downloaded this app only to be able to drop this review. Had there been any worse possible, I'd have given it. You can't bloody disrespect my freedom of choice and force me to download your app. I'm happy with the website; have some respect for that. Deleting right after.",negative
When i open this app and reading some post then i quite motivate myself... Kinds of great man speach and their exprience that should encourage me to grow myself .. thank you.. for such a motivating app,positive
Very useful app. It can clear any doubt that comes up in my mind in any field.,positive
"Ad links open in Chrome, whole other links have an inbuilt browser? Haha that was my tipping point. Trying to control much, no thanks, you can have your app back. I'm leaving quora, it's nothing but a glorified news feed anyways",negative
"Just Amazing. There is always someone to answer to your queries. Many a times you can relate with the existing content and you won't even need to put up your question. The content is rich. You will see multiple answers to questions you are interested in. Ask anything from movies , sports, politics, food and what not and you will get answers. Also good for just browsing through its contents. #AlwaysTeachesSomething",positive
"Why should I download the app? Why can't I read your content via the site itself? It's annoying. And no, I'm not going to download your app because you keep pushing it in my face. At most I won't get to read the response to a particular question. Nothing more.",negative
I love reading Quara's content. But forcing to install the app has made a really bad impression on you guys. Didn't expect this from you. Its up to the users to decide whether to have the app or not. Really disappointed.,negative
"Don't force people to download your app. Let them use the browser website and stop the pop-ups, or shut down your website.",neutral
This is a great app but FORCING your users to download the app is downright dictatorship. I have a friend's phone since mine is at the service centre getting a new screen. I tried just logging on the website to get my daily Quora tidbits and you are forcing me to download the app?! This is nonsense. You should be ashamed of yourselves,negative
I made a account just to read 1. My email gets spammed but that can be fixed easily. 2. Every 2 seconds on the website it makes you download the app 3. Once you do download it theres a ad every second Making a acount and downloading something thats this crappy its unbelievable awfull truly awfull,negative
"Quora Website as social media is great, and my favorite. However, I expect much from the App that isn't there. 1. There are NO TABS, 2. The BOOKMARKS are lost in menus 3 . CACHE stores permanently unless manually removed 4. Oersonal settings are bewildering, 5. No insertion of pictures or text editing inbuilt, 6. No DARK MODE, 7. No Font CHANGE, 8. Takes time in loading,... Perhaps I ask too much. BUT I LOVE QUORA, SO IT GOES!",negative
"So So App on Android. Doesn't allow ""Select"" word by double tap. When we add a character to a word, it suddenly removes space before that word and we have to use 3 to 4 taps to edit a word !!! It auto-repeats 1st alphabet of a word especially if we have made it Bold !!! Asking a question is quite difficult. After writing a question, you give list of similar questions. Below that please give an ""Add"" question button. Followed by ""Request"" Answers button.",negative
"This is an spying app, whatever you discuss with anyone on daily basis and you will find a notification related to that topic. Quora is using our conversation through mic.",neutral
"I am facing a problem with this app. Whenever I try to copy an answer's url, I click on share button, then I click ""copy to clipboard"" button. But the url isn't getting copied using this procedure. Please fix it.",negative
"I am downvoting not because the app is horrible, but even before I could choose to download it, notifications kept popping up telling me to install the app. Also, I could not get rid of the notification untill I went ahead and actually downloaded it.",negative
"I will not be forced to install any application. Maybe I would if there was something special about it, but there's not. You have lost one customer. I have deleted the app from two devices and will never open another Quora discussion sent via e-mail. ---- Stop bugging me to install or open Quora. I'll choose how to use Quora and won't accept being directed otherwise. Knowing it won't affect you much, if this continues, I will delete the app from my Android tablet.",negative
Why you people forcing us to download the app while trying to read the content? If we need it then definitely we do download it. That is the reason i gave you two star!!!!!!,negative
This is because of you forcing me to download the app. I like the content though that this platform has got some to offer. Let me decide whether I have to download or not,neutral
"Absolutely love the stories on Quora, any advice you are looking for there is always someone that can help and advise. Quora is also very easy to use, believe me you will be hooked.",positive
"Forcing me to download app when I want to use web version. You are already making money off of me with ads, is that not enough? Do you really need to force me to download the app so you can sell all my data too?",negative
"I think it is pitiful that you people pop up in my emails, and when I start reading something that interested me like information on BPD it completely cut me off forcing me to install app to even finish reading article. Hideous you all should be kicked off yourself.",negative
I really like this app as it has helped me improved considerably and provided me a lot of information on different spheres of life.,positive
"Despite having a very good internet connection, images in an answer wont load leaving blank spaces across the answer. Initially i gave 5stars for the old version of the app which works completely fine. This happened after the update.",neutral
"Very useful app, first I saw this quora in website and i started reading its answer and i made my account in it and it sometime shows to download app so i tried it it has many features in app rather than website download it. It is very useful",positive
There isa lot of rubbish content which needs to be filtered. Sometimes it helps you look for what you need but otherwise it's just a waste. From this application i have come to realize that there are many jobless empty minds out there.,negative
Great mix of content across many many topics. Quality of content and filtering still needs lot of work. I hope it improves soon.,positive
"The app isn't particularly bad, but I don't want it. I'd rather just use my browser so I'm not cluttering my phone with unnecessary apps. Unfortunately Quora doesn't allow that and they lock you out of the website to redirect you to the app. Distasteful business practice. Just like being forced to log in to view questions.",negative
Couldn't answer questions or upvote (no reasons given). Googled how to contact Quora & when I tried clicking on this a box kept coming up telling me I'm not able to connect to the internet which is BS as I've been able to do this all along - it's just this site which directs me to this lie. Finally go back to the Quora page: tells me I've been blocked as I'm not using my real full name as my username. It's not as if they don't have all my details. Blocking Quora from search results. Minus 5/5‚≠ês.,negative
Forced to install to finish reading a response. I prefer to read in an internet app. This is a terrible marketing strategy and this 1 star represents my disapproval.,negative
1. It provides answers to challenging questions as posted. 2. It platform constitutes brainy individuals from major field of study/academia. 3. It's for now a reliable source of information about mathematics courses that I find it hard to obtain solution. QUORA : REACH OUT FOR EXCELLENCE 8/10.,positive
I use quora app regularly. Everyday in fact. When my mobile ran out of battery i used my friend's mobile to browse temporarily. The site never allowed me to read more than a single post and kept insisting that I download the app. So the question is why should a regular user should be forced to download the app.,negative
"Best app for finding answers and for just passing time by scrolling through questions. But here also a there is a problem, this app consumers a considerable amount of memory and starts lagging. Fix this out make a lite version, otherwise everything is great.",negative
"Pathetic! They don't let you use the website without creating an account and when you do, you gotta install the app too! I mean seriously, why can't you allow for it to work in the browser only, you're showing ads anyway! guys reddit is a lot better. Though I appreciate the community, I highly discourage Quora App.",negative
Forcing everyone tp download the app! Nice tactic. This won't increase your app usage but will definitely decrease the website views as a backfire to this ridiculous tactic.,negative
Stop nagging people to get your app. The web version is better. If I need it i know how to get it. It is crappy of quora to block mobile browser usage of their website.,negative
"Installed the app, never opened it, just to give 1star rating for that a**hole who thought it would be a good idea to shove this app into the readers face while browsing. Uninstalling.",negative
"I dont even know why quora used almost 1.1 GB ram for it to operate. I mean evertime i use quora for 1-2 hour on my phone, it get laggy and feels heavy to navigate. Need to fix this ASAP.",negative
Needs more optimization for speedy transition and make the UI more appealing.,neutral
I like it but sometimes I get confused...probably being a Senior doesn't help any.,neutral
"Too much ads, exit button on the bottom is annoying, this kind of button usually belongs to ads so I always end up pressing on it thinking its ad.",negative
"I was used to going thru quora using the web browswr. But now Quora has started forcing to download the app by a pop up that cannot be closed. I hate using the app. If I could have given 0 stars,I would have done that for sure. I will stop using quora most probably because the app is stupid. It is always crashing and does not work 90% of the time",negative
A very nice useful App to find/seek more info/ knowledge of various subjects. i love it...,positive
I saw this app on a Snapchat add and it said i would be able to see of i was blocked from other users storys but instead its an app that is just for gossip/information and i am disappointed because i was using the app anyways and there are to many adds and the game was just continuing to crash so i deleted it and reinstalled it and its still terrible thank you for your time üòÅ,negative
It's very intresting site for reading anything... And special thing is here.. All containt are creted by us so it's more useful and exprienced... I recommend,positive
"Covering your head in tinfoil will prevent you from having to install the app. Bwah, ha,ha!!!......Just kidding..It did nothing....I was still forced to install it....What's up with that? Seems kinda shady.",negative
I don't think I can regret downloading the app. Wonderful platform for getting informed and sharing your thoughts. Awesome!,positive
"I prefer to read on the site rather than on the app, but now I cannot because you force to use the app on the phone rathet than let us use the browser. So here you go 1 star because this is really annoying and I prefer to stop using your platform rather than use your app.",negative
"If i could give less than a star ,it would have been better because you people force others to download the app otherwise the webpage wil not work. Wow great strategy .",negative
"why the use of app is compulsory ? i was viewing one post in chrome ,and signed from my gmail for quora, but it was not allowing the web view and foecefully downloaded the quora app. why u guys have any problem in web view?????",negative
I WILL NEVER GET YOUR APP BECAUSE YOU COMPELLED ME TO INSTALL IT IN THE MIDDLE OF READING ON THE WEBSITE MULTIPLE TIMES AND ON TOP OF THAT I CAN'T REMOVE THAT POPUP. Installed it just to give this review.,negative
"This app is a pain in the ass! If you answer a question that isn't part of the original list of topics that you posted when you joined, you'll get nagged into coming up with a ""credential"". I answered this question ""Does Scientology blackmain Travolta and Cruise?""; I offered my opinion. Within days I was asked for a ""credential"". I got so fed up, I deleted my answer. You get to the point where you don't want to answer questions about anything, or you just uninstall.",negative
"It is a much better App in this entity, & my Apologies for the very poor rating I had posted about them. A very Fantaboulous, Brilliant, Professional app. Highly Recommended.",positive
"Quora is a social community, of positivity, that grants all of us the opportunity to ask questions that need be asked & allows us to answer those very same questions while speaking our mind & keeping it real simultaneously. I very much enjoy this app as it gives me the opportunity to communicate with other brilliant minds.",positive
Amazing app. You find every questions answer given by the expert by its own experience. Also you can also join the conversation and have your experiences and opinions on the questions.,positive
I have just started with Quora and I think I have started liking it. But how I have not yet submitted any of my writing or articles. I am enjoying sharing some of the answers respecting the Hindi language. It's fun. Like it.,positive
Could not use web version on phone and was forced to download app. Options from blocker were 1) Continue on app 2) I already have app What kinda nonsense is that?,negative
"At first it was fun to answer questions.but it would make me use my real name which made me very uncomfortable. I understand credibility but typing something out isn't real proof anyway. It's hard to answer more personal questions when your real name is out there floating. Then they would block me from being able to add questions. Why am I not allowed to add my own questions,they were unique ones too,not duplicates.anyway,ive had it for like a month and im just done with it.hope this helps.",negative
"i am not able to see any of the photos in the answers, even if i am using the latest quora by regularly updating the app. this needs to be settled.",negative

Now i'm a regularly quora reader...so...thanks quora for being a part of my daily routine...,positive
Site will not let you read articles without opening a pop-up to the app. Your app does not have the same features my browser has. Let me choose how I want to view your site or I won't visit at all.,negative
"This is such an excellent app i am glad i downloaded it,before using this app i was reading posts on the quora site and i thought that downloading this app won't make a huge difference but turns out i was wrong",positive

Especially when I click on the app icon. This does not seem to happen on my FB app and I feel for a reading app like Quora, it is important to have this feature in as it helps people in reading an article, toggle to pursue more in depth info and return to continue.",positive
"Not pleased that I have to install an app to access a service, that I signed up for, that was previously available via the simple and ubiquitous web browser. Why do I need yet another app?? The less apps I install, the better the experience with my phone. It's really that simple. Bad policy folks.",negative
It's nice.. very informative on an objective and a subjective point of view.,positive
Really bad design. Crashes constantly. Also hard to find & save things.,negative
"My experience using quora's question-answer/answer-question too gather correct information about any subject I can think of has proven useful for me. In my opinion, as time goes on and participation of people 'in the know' continue adding too the Quora knowledge base, an effect take shape that help civilized society weave a magnificent quest in search of the miraculous.

"Love this app. It helps a lot to increase my knowledge as well as to improve my english. Best platform to spend the time over social media like FB, INSTA & etc.",positive
I don't have the quora app. It is really pathetic that quora does not let you read articles while you are logged in as a Google user. The only work around is to log off from the browser but then again it doesn't reload the same article.,negative
That was a Dirty trick quora i like the website in general so i installed but FORCING all of you users to install is very risky and will drop your rating like crazy you dont know what situation people are in wether they lack a compatible phone so they cant go to your app or your phone has horrible storage issues or even worse the person is borrowing another persons phone you need to be careful about the actions you do i still do use it so it got 3 stars,negative

You are unable to add details to question and even if you add the in the title of the question you can use no more than 250 characters which is not enough for any kind of problem. Even here in the review I can type more 500 characters! DEFINETLY I DONT RECOMEND IT!!!!!!!,negative

Unfortunately took many trolls and Topo many people asking silly questions (facts they could/should do a search for before posting) or variations (ask a question about country A, repeat with countries b to z) in the home of getting paid for questions by quora.

I dont care if the app is good, as a professional web developer, i can tell you, this is not how its done, and forcing the app on the visitor is idiocy. Add the button to close the banner and make it less intrusive. Why should i even try the app if you f‚Ä¢d up the website's UX so miserably for me? ?",negative
Best online guide and better than your school/college teachers . But it may not solve your questions by others as early as possible.,positive
I was very active on Quora until they released this app. Now when I try to read ftom the site in my mobile browser a popup appears that cannot be closed and prevents me from reading.

"Quora is a good website actually, I like it a lot. But the pop-up that notify to install quora app and interupting your reads everytime is annoying as hell, you cannot even close those pop-up. It just there, forcing you to continue to install the apps. Obviously, 1 star for the apps itself.",negative
"I used to love Quora, but spam questions have damaged the spirit of the site since they started offering people money for each answer their questions receive.

I'm hoping Medium can provide the quality information I was getting from Quora without the incessant spam bots (and advertising).",negative

You write a question into google, the first thing that pops up is a Quora tread where someone asked the same thing as you and there is an aswer for your question.

"Rich and engaging.But some times, it is seen that unverified historical narrations are posted as answers. Sources are solicited to be referred to.",neutral
"Every time when app is minimized and after opening it, app refreshes. So whatever you are reading is gone.",neutral
Quora should not force people to update App. Its irritating to update app again and again. Even of its neccesary it should be done only once in two year or so,negative
I installed this app just to give 1 star review. So much pestering on mobile site. I can't even select a word to do a google search on chrome mobile.,negative
Quora application is very good and knowledgeable so I like this. But in this app I really need üëâ dark mod feature for more time uses still night. so I expect from quora team to provide this feature.,positive
Best app ever...Thnx to these app my point of view has changed on so many matters.. And the way people express their stories is just awsm to read.. I'm totally addicted to these app..,positive
I wanted to rate it 5. They just need to work on the display of the followed spaces well. We cant know the name by looking at those icons. N there better ways to arrange them.,neutral
Why are we forced to download app and not be able to view quora from the browser. I resent that. Ofcourse endless app updates make it even worse.,negative
"""Dark Mode"" should be added as a feature in Quora. A very good app if you're functional and keen about knowledge.",positive
"It's less stable than an upside down cardhouse. It's usable, if you like apps that crash every two minutes to two seconds. And no, it does not remember where you left off.",negative
"Hi Quora, The app seems to have a bug. it's not displaying images anymore in my android phone. Reading answers with only text is fine, but when images are referred, the context is lost",negative
"Quora gives my phone sticky keys, and is stopping repeatedly. They merge some questions, then un-merge them. I'm going to give them a little more time to fix things, but when my patience runs out, I'll throw it off my phone.",negative
"The content is really good, but not the app. If you're just going to read Q/A, then it's really perfect. However, if you want to ask a question or want to comment, then expect the app to freeze momentarily and to be annoyed really badly.",negative
I love this app I can answer questions that are so incredibly interesting and I am the answer to certain things for people with depression and I'm glad I got this app this should stay a five star app,positive
"Edited 9/6/19 They got the upvote thing fixed, but now the app crashes after three minutes. Seriously, Quora? You can do better than this.",negative
One star less for the app's somewhat buggy performance App keeps crashing at thr slightest move.,negative
"Quora is an interesting app. It's like a more personable Google but with a crazy party going on in a library and annoying neighbors trying to stop it because they weren't invited. I'm still navigating the set up and once I understand it more, perhaps I'll give it more stars.",positive
"I do love Quora. But I got too many ceashes when I'm using it. The app just constantly stopped in any of time. Please fix this bug. Note : Device : Redmi 4X, Android : 7.1.2",negative
The apps keep on stopping automatically when i scroll while reading. Please update the error,negative
"This version is crashing often. Also, if i navigate out of the app and come back, the content feed has refreshed and I seem to be missing a lot of good stuff on my feed.",negative
Your app was crashing since last couple of days. Today I have upgraded your app. Still it is crashing repeatedly. I have noticed that this problem occurs while commenting and scrolling.,negative
"The app shuts down automatically sometimes. Please fix it. As an app, its nice. Lots of information though many are not genuine.",negative
"I find this very entertaining, informative & sometimes how rediculous some people are. One has to be real enough to sort the truth from just good story tellers. Some are honest to goodness users whilst others are just comedians loving just writing whatever, truth, half truths and plain lies. On the whole, I love it.",positive
App is closing regularly while being used. This is occurring in regular intervals. This issue just started today and already encountered it 3 times.,negative
"I just cannot open the bookmarks,it keeps on loading even with a 60 mbps connection...My entire collection of answers of some great people that influenced the world,all gone in vain.",negative
"Being a writer as well as a reader, Quora has become one of my most favourite apps. The plethora of knowledge added with the real life experience gives a boost to my day to day schedule. Kudos to the team !",positive
Way too many ads... I wanted to use this cool little app but there are so many ads in it i just cant take it anymore,negative
My go to app during my short commute time on the subway. A good way to have a good laugh over funny /interesting story based answer & gaining insightful knowledge among the crowd sourced answers.,positive
Thus is a quite interesting app for a person like me who has more questions than answers. But i have one request from the developers please add the option for word meaning by clicking on the word as reading skills of everybody are not equal. Otherwise it is all good.,positive
I can't read an article on the web without being interrupted and forced to the install the app. Im not going to open another email let alone open this damn app. Unacceptable,negative
"The biggest bug I find annoying is in the answer text, math formulas aren't rendered (works for questions).",negative
"My 1-star rating only applies to the app, the website, and the services, not to the community. What I disliked: 1. account is required to read more than 1 article, 2. spams inbox with ""daily digest"" once you create an account, 3. no release notes, 4. people are paid money to ask stupid questions, 5. mobile browser version doesn't let you read and asks you to download this, 6. uses more battery than necessary, 7. hard to search for answers you've read before. There's more, but 500 character limit",negative
"I am avid reader of Quora. I mostly use it from web but lately I'm reading from App. App really sucks. Many a times I get connection error, sometime previous answer is loaded when I click kn answer. Try to fix up these bugs.",negative
You can no longer use it elsewhere without being forced to download the app or completely reset every couple minutes. It's become horrible,negative
Only downloaded this app to give a 1 star rating. This is because Quora wouldn't let me read in mobile web. A popup comes up asking me to install the app which I have no way of closing. And there is no way to open the link in the app. Not sure what is the point of the popup. Will be uninstalling the app immediately after the review is posted.,negative
Its bad i cant answer any questions or change any settings its just loading and loading and at the end its says network issue but there is no problem viewing other questions,negative
"Very good. Very interesting and useful questions and answers also with full details, clarification.",positive
"I was forced to download the app. However I didmot mind it as I use Quora frequently. However, the app will not show any photos. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared all the caches, but nothing helped. Reading an answer without being able to see the attached photos is a really bad experience.",negative
a lot of interesting information and helpful facts from people all over. I love the travel tips and useful experience that people share. It's a first class app to me.,positive
"4 stars because I like Quora and its contents(most of it). The App make the page refresh everytime I open it, even though I accidentally close it and immediately open. I personally feel that it should ask the user to refresh and not automatically get refresh.",positive
Lately it's crashing everytime I open it... I uninstalled and reinstalled but no use,negative
The quora ap seems pretty good. I used to answer on line but now use the ap. The page options seem to be placed at the bottom of the screen while on line was at the top. Pverall it seems ok but not really much different.,positive
Why does Quora force the app on people. It works fine/better on the webpage but they keep forcing a stupid pop up that you can't get rid of making it pretty much unusable without the app.,negative
It's a great app to keep ourself updated to day-day life and also to connect to different people and a great alternative to popular addictive social apps.,positive
"Its a good app, works well. There's so many options that it can be difficult to find what you want...seems just to be an indexing problem",positive
A perfect place where you can share your perspective and learn. I just downloaded the app without any reason today I am member of Quora family for past five years.Great app.,positive
Simple. It forced me to download the app while I was reading from the web on my phone. ImI couldn't read what I was reading unless I downloaded the app,negative
"I used to read Quora on my phone via the website. Now Quora has continual pop-ups forcing to use this app. So, I will stop reading Quora entirely. At least Reddit offers the choice of using its app or continuing to read via its website. I do not need more apps cluttering up my phone and using its memory when websites exist that have the same information. I had to install the app to leave this review and will delete it as soon as I see this review posted",negative
It's a very good platform gain knowledge and share your answers. You can also find answers if you want üòé,positive
Please add an option as to view viewed answer as it becomes an outrageous task to find out the answer I have viewed but not upvoted it. Sometimes my feed refreshes and I am unable to find that awesome answer again.,negative
"Service is good, But The App is so so so slow. It takes minimum 2 to 3 minutes in loading. Sometimes it can't open. Whether heaviest games working properly, but this app not working. You should make a lite version of this app.",negative
"I'm a very patriotic cowboy. Born in 52 kinda just missed nam. Watered down relate to Patton. Anyway, Quora fills in my hunger for anything' military and flying. Please keep up the good work and accuracy.",positive
I enjoy this app. It's interesting. I learn a lot of info and the variety of subjects is amazing.,positive
The images doesn't load on the app whenever I try to read something it's awfully annoying... Please do something about it.... And i have a 50mbps connection then also facing problems...,negative
"It's good for asking questions but for searching questions, you still have to use Google, and it has the worst preferences system, the user preferences system should be made better.",negative
"Even a retired man like me too can learn something new whenever Quora is opened. It's definitely better than other social media, simply because, people's personal experiences throw light on every problem on the earth, which should amply be useful to the seekers of answers/solutions. It's time to uplift one's life with the help of Quora in shedding the cocoon of ignorance My request to Quora- 'strive to keep up the standard.' May it serve ALL like the sacred scripts and change their lives!",positive
"I love this website. I do. But, I prefer the website over the app. Yet every time I'm on the website, you are pushing the app. So much so, you get a link to download the app and you get stuck. You can't just get rid of the pop-up. If you pick ""already have the app"" it sends you to the play store to get the app. Tl;dr: stop pushing the app so freaking hard.",positive
Halfway reading an article forced to download this app. App doesn't even open the article I was reading. Impossible to find the article I was reading in app and browser keeps throwing me to app. Horrible.,negative
"I was forced to download this and now it spams me with random pop ups. Dont download. This is an addictive site, and the ""veiws"" arent even actual real views so it tricks you with rewards that are exaggerated. For example, if you click on a question with 20 answers and look at only the first answer, the rest also get views. Just a warning so you dont let it catch and consume your time and effort for fake achievements.",negative
"Sharing ideas about the world is very important and interesting, because development goes well with the sharing of ideas",positive
I'm unable to use it through web! Why do you want to force people to download app?? And UI needs lot of improvement!,negative
It makes download the app. Thats not being very fair. I rather just used the web. And not spaxe in my phone.. Talk about control! Ugh..,negative
Why images are not properly displayed ...? Everytime i open the post there that images even author pic will disappear ... Fix it...and reply,negative
Super functional.. works smoothly in both iOS & Android...so keep it going. Cheers....!!,positive
It's pretty convenient to be able to use quora on my phone. The app is easy to navigate! I highly reccomend this app.,positive
"Can someone at Quora work and get the app in dark theme? I read it often and if you check my Quora consumption is too high, it pains my eyes and I wonder why Quora hasn't yet rolled out the dark theme, the app sometimes takes more than a minute to load the article and its getting poor and inferior its UI. Do roll out the dark theme and if possible work on a lite version of Quora coz the app sucks at this point of time! It was really awesome and still is to get information but seriously waiting !!",negative
"Good for knowledge sharing, but many good answers got collapsed due to whatever reasons but this didn't happen in case of some bad answers. There are many bad answers in Quora many of them are still available, some very good answers which you feel bitter truths will get collapsed. This is one bad thing about Quora. But actually it is a very good app.",negative
Do not even waste my time with others. They make subtle changes to answers without asking making for some misunderstandings. Nothing is perfect. Quora does this sometimes.,negative
Its a good experience to be on Quora. An excellent global platform for learning and sharing knowledge.,positive
"Pst, forcing me to download your app so you can attempt to 'market' your service better is extremly dissatisfying. I opened a link to get my question answered, not download an app.",negative
Its been a very informative app but i am facing a serious issue in it. It doesn't store its state when i resume it from the recent apps. Its annoying and many times i didn't find those articles again which i missed due to this issue. Please fix it.,negative
I hate Quora. First they force you to sign up before you can even read articles. Now I'm being forced to download another app on my phone where the website worked just fine. Absolutely disgraceful forcing their users to download an app just to read the content.,negative
Great answers to your questions. A little confusing to use at first but solvable.,positive
"Very informative. Actually the most informative site I've seen. The only caveat is app could barr you from answering or asking questions with virtually no reason at all, and it sucks",positive
"Horrible experience. I cant even so much as look at what I'm trying to read on chrome and it forces me to get the app, and afterwards I cant even find what im looking for.",negative
"Getting VERY TIRED OF UNWANTED REFRESHES. I will leave the app while writing a comment to check a fact or something, and then when I return to the app it ""helpfully"" refreshes my feed and the answer I was commenting on is gone. I think people can DRAG DOWN TO REFRESH when they need to. The automatic refresh is NOT HELPFUL.",negative
"The app gives what you need - quick access to Quora, topics are easy to read, navigation is fast and simple. The only downside but a major pain in the butt is that it resets so often. If I check something out in Chrome and go back to Quora, it forgets what I was reading and completely resets. Sad.",positive
"I recently discovered Quora and wondered why I missed such a truly wonderful app. It's contents are very enriching and it touches virtually everything, from medical, aviation, and other spheres not to talk of the questions and answers on many subjects. Thumbs up, Quora.",positive
Whats wrong with this app. Works best with browser but with this app it do not even load pages. Please fix the issue.,negative
"Sharing the information in this platform is really nice , makes us kniw more things in different perspectives.",positive
"I was reading the Quora website, and clicked the X several times to close the app ad. Instead of closing, it dumped me here. Installed. Rated. Removed. Hate it.",negative
"Its amazing app I have never seen before. First I want to be aConten writer but my english not so good. So, I began start learning english on Quora. After that I realize its more than learning english. I have learn lot of things from Quora. (Sorry for any typing misstek) Thanks",positive
The images don't show completely for any answer.I am only able to see a part of it.,negative
well its a good platform to share your ideas but forcing to download the app is highly disappointing.please allow the readers to have their time as such .,negative
"The quora platform among others is very outstanding where it affords users the opportunity to ask and view numerous answers even to a question, but this app continually fails even after several updates to save recent activities such that when you leave the app, more often than not, you never get redirected to where you left it. Something should be done by the developers ASAP. Thanks",neutral
Just downloaded and installed the app for a short moment so that I can leave a 1star and tell you guys to go screw yourselves for forcing me to install your app to continue reading an interesting answer. Uninstalling now!,negative
All clickbait bs that just spamms you saying to download. It litterally gave me the options download or .i already have the app. Ni matter which i chose it sent me to the download. Absolute garbage,negative
"Don't update this app. I am not able to see any stories and the pages which am following. I'm really very disappointed. Kindly, solve this problem.",negative
I love to read on quora. The most lovable platform of mine. However it forced to download the app to read some article that is why iam giving only 2 star otherwise platform is superb,positive
"Alright, i love reading on quora. But it is annoying that it forces you to install the app. There should be an option to continue reading online. You know, not everyone has an advanced phone. This is nothing but pure promotion of consumerism.",negative
I like quora .its really the best platform . No matter its website or app. Yes its really helpful in my daily life and my goal,positive
Recently i tried to change my profile image. But it automatically tilts the image i upload towards right. So trying to cheat it I uploaded a already tilted image. But this time i just fixes the image in a tilted position itself. Please fix this issue. Else everyone has to bend their head 90¬∞ to see me,negative
This is one of the most interesting Apps anyone should have. Its filled with questions and answers anyone can relate too. I love answering question on subjects I know and have life experiences with. When asking a question you receive a variety of answers from professionals or from others who have had the same experiance. This App is the best and I would suggest it to everyone!,positive
"The topics covered are incredibly detailed which makes them even more interesting. I'm not sure how I stumbled on this app, but I'm delighted to have done it!!!",positive
"Can't adjust fine size. Forces you to pick 10 topics, 3 would be okay but 10 is ridiculous.",negative
I did not have access to it with my mail ID and rather forcfully askef to down load the this app. This is not pleasant to me,negative
It overheated my phone. It drained the battery very fast. I uninstalled it and installed it 3 times. It continued doing that. Maybe it is incompatible with some android phones. Mine is an LG V20.,negative
Brilliant. Covers most Topics that are of interest to you. Gives varied answers from many Users. The grammar and language is of high content. Rarely do you find abusive language. It is sometimes better than Google when you want answers.,positive
"I cannot access my feed. It keeps showing my profile. I don't see an option to go back to my feed. I logged out a.d logged back in, and re installed the app after uninstalling, it still doesn't work. Fix it please.",negative
The app is great for reading important article for the high school students. The app is also good for the asking questions.,positive
It is a good and fabulous app to learn something what we dont know and may becime a good learning app for students.,positive
I learned & I am learning so many things from quora. QUORA is really a very helpful app for your personality development. I love this app. Through this app I'm connected to the all successful Person in the world. Thank you Quora.,positive
"Stupid app. I uninstalled the pp. I preferred reading in crome (mobile version) itself but after uninstalling the app, the quora site repeatedly kept on asking for reading in app.. means either u install it else u won't be able to read in crome.. it just doesn't alloy normal website reading (in mobile). I don't just uninstall the app and also unsubscribed from the daily mail list as well. Quora, you can't force me..",negative
The best platform to learn and share your knowledge Anyone can get any problem solutions. Best platform....,positive
You have to download it but i wanted to use it on browser. App shows error a lot of times.,negative
Too frequently updated. And gets slower every time. Takes ages to open a single answer. The usefulness is same. App using pleasure is reducing. Please remember what made the app good in previous versions before updating again and again. App is becoming too heavy. I am deducting 1 star.,negative
Love this app! I learn so much from asking questions and reading answers. Fantastic way to get insight directly from human resources. People are generous with their time to share their thoughts and ideas.,positive
I'm kinda a loner but have been needing someone intelligent to talk to. Tried AI but that wasn't the answer. Found Quora and problem solved! No limit to the topics and you can request answers from anyone. From your grandma to the CEO of a company! Thanks again,positive
"Absolute garbage, forcing me to use their app and not letting me use the website on mobile, I'll play your game but be prepared to lose a few rating stars.",negative
I have a problem regarding viewing phtotos through this app. Every time it fails to open several images included in answers.,negative
"Fine I guess. It works alright, but i hate that you are FORCES to have this app I use once every two months maximum when I could quickly do things a browser.",negative
It's really helpful to get information about the issue or question one has. Most of answers are from experienced and knowledgeable individual. This is a great place share a discussion matter.,positive
"If I to rate Quora as a website, this will be an easy 5-star. But as an app, not really. The interface when you open it on browser or on PC is actually much better. One problem that really upset me very much is that everytime I switched tabs to open another apps in multitask (even only for a second such as opening a chat), I can't return to the previous questions / answers that I read. It is so annoying that the feeds refresh everytime I reopen the apps. This is that one big ""No"".",negative
Some thing went wrong with the app after the update it says protocol error. Kindly look into,negative
"Great platform to learn, educate, get knowledge of n no. Of things of whole universe. The inclusion of spaces made better way to learn about particular area and skills and experiences. I started using it from Quora's kid age üòúand am going to be with Quora till my life. üòáüòá",positive
"Keeps asking me to down load the app half way through reading it in browser and wont let you go any farther til you down load it.I dont want the app. I like having it in my email, i have more important apps on my phone that i will not delete for this app. Stop asking me. Im unsubcribing to quora. Dont waste your time with this.",negative
"Very informative, but u have to watch for people leading from behind!!!",positive
"It features a lot of interesting questions and complex answers on different topics. After a while, however, the topics do not vary as much, and the same question repeats itself with a different answer. Also, there seem to be increasingly many bots and trolls. Too bad for such a good app.",negative
"Dear Quora, please stop forcing me to download your damn app, i dont have space on my phone and i want to access the web platform but your instrusive pop-ups urging me to download the app are preventing me from doing so... this is a minor point that causes terrible UX.. please address this if u can.. Kindly, an avid lover of your platform",negative
Quora is an amazing website. But I'd rather use it on the web browser than the app. The UI is not nearly as pleasing on the app as it is for the website. Pictures load fully and then they dont display properly.,negative
NO I DON'T WANT TO INSTALL THE DAMN APP. I used to read stories on my phone browser..but these idiots got the bright idea to force people to install their app. Well good job..now i just won't use your platform at all. Morons,negative
"Very educational and informative. It's a good experience to share thoughts, information, and ideas with many others on Quora.",positive
"This is very best platform to share your talent through writing. You just don't to worry about content because Quora makes good question to appear always on your way. You have so much flexibility to write your answers. One step login even verification even you are new user is just amazed me , you just go and enter your email and start answering. At last I just wannt to say that this is the biggest platform to get your answer in writing. Good work QUORA just keep it up.üòäüòäüòéüòéüòéüòäüòä",positive
"This app is very educative and easy to use,it contain answers to your various questions and courses .",positive
"I have no issues with the purpose behind Quora; posting answers and coming up with creative content is a passtime hobby of mine now, but from my experience, this is NOT user friendly for phone users. The website keeps forcing you to download the app(honestly the website interface is better than the app), and even when you download the app, it's so slow to a point where it's not even worth using. Hell, even the website makes my phone hang occasionally, and my phone supposedly has 4GB RAM.",negative
This app help me out move on in life. As views if different people I was unable to understand things but because of this app I started learning life and new things. Thank you Quora by core of my üíì..,positive
"This is my favourite app, I get to read, ask and converse with lots of people. I've learnt from the many experiences shared and I love every bit of it. Cheers quora üòÖüòÄüòÇüòÉüòÑ",positive
hang ups are frequent and not very user friendly if I cant view videos in the stories on one tap....slow app...,negative

"It has been 4 days since Quora app is inaccessible on wifi, it only worked when I switched to mobile data. I only subscribed to mobile data for quora but today it has stopped working on mobile data as well. Can't connect to the internet"" is the error. I tried uninstalling and then re installed the app. Still no luck.",negative
"The content by contributors is good but people are being forced to use app, I prefer the webpage so I use it. Please understand else I would be annoyed and forced to leave",negative
I would rate 0 stars if I could. Their mobile site is unusable and links directly to here instead of just letting me browse in peace without forcing me to download an app for it.,negative
"I don't like the way it forces me to donwloaded the app where in fact lots of my reading happens when I check notification from my email. Its annoying that I'm not able to continue reading via web where in I only happen to see interesting article. I'm not going to stay too long reading anyway using the app. One more thing, the article that I'm reading is not showing on the app what sense does it make if I can't find it the way I saw it in the email notification.",negative
"I'd rather give it a 4.9 than solid 5 because of how many updates there are. Besides that, the app is quick and simple, especially useful for using one of the largest platforms online. Really amazing",positive
Hello I have recently started facing issues with quora app. I have internet connection but it still says connect to internet.

Whenever i try to write a long answer through app it crashes every time and I have to start from beginning.,negative
App is very good but some time when i click on question the screen will turn into white and nothing happens .,negative
I enjoy some time everyday looking up articles mostly from firsthand experiences or informations you can't just look in detail through academic papers. The topics are very diverse and the people aren't intoxicating.,positive
"It's not as useful a tool for knowledge as it initially seems. It's billed as a platform for the quest for knowledge, and sometimes it is. But the majority of the time it's a ""safe space"". Being nice is far more important than stating facts, definitions, and data. An objective comment on a factually incorrect answer will be removed if the incorrect person, or the fragile moderators, take offense. My last comment which was removed simply cited a Webster's dictionary definition.",negative
It is a really good app but since last few days i cannot open it everytime it says No Internet Access. Is there any sort of problem?,negative
Good going with quoraüòä this is the only i personally always prefer for asking certain ques to. Well to be very straight forward i would like to recommend this app to people of every age because learning is a part of living if this is the mantra of your life then go for this amazing app which'll help u to increase ur knowledge in every field u like or is interested to.. also u can help others by answering their doubts. So this app not only helps us but also gives us an opportunity to help others‚ù§,positive
"I was forced into downloading this stupid app to veiw any material sent to me through my email, absolutely ridiculous. Way to extort your users into downloading something they don't need at all. I like the information but hate Quora. Whoever approved making the app mandatory to veiw material is a total dick. The internet browser version is far superior and more pleasant to use.",negative
No way of deleting requests or notifications without responding to EVERY one. Too time-consuming. Also requires email verification for every login. Grow up...,negative
That's amazing application .... Thanks Quro team for making such a kind of application ....it really help me in my Study .. Interface is also good ... you deserve 10 star out of 5 .. Cheers üçª,positive
I don't like how the website keeps telling to open the app. If I'm on the website I'm on the freaking website and the pop up won't go away.,negative
"Asking and answering questions. Very interesting! Also, you can become a paid writer very easily. Best app i've ever found!",positive
"Thanks to this app, I've leant so much. Though the notification in my email is disturbing but it really helped.",positive
The most useful app and the most used app by me. Helps us a lot and others too we can share our personal experience and the main feature is its anonymous mode we can post our content anonymously so that others can't identify us.,positive
Ok quora is not bad . The concept is good but the app we are using is a real evil. Every time I wrote an answer it suddenly close itself or refresh itself and that question disappears. It is better to use quora as on website and not on the app.,negative
"Using it very much lately, very much helpful. I would like it was kinda more personalized",positive
Fascinating variety of everyday and specific questions and answers to all aspects of life and living. Very diverse and interesting app.,positive
"Awesome, helps you get your doubts solved, it's just that you should enable an option that allows you to ask your diagram based problems, that'll probably make it the best app.",positive
"This app always presents the message ""unable to connect to the internet"" and so I can open it but cannot see any content. All my other apps work and I definitely have an internet connection. The real problem with Quora is that they force you to use the app rather than permitting access via a Chrome browser.",negative

"Don't force me to use your app. Just don't. Whether to use mobile bowser or app, it's my choice, not yours. Just don't FORCE!

It's quite good actually coz u come to know the experience of other buddies the like come of a situation or take helps from their experiences.,positive
Forced to install app!! It gives two options which take you to the app store 1- download the free app. 2 - i already have the app,negative
Best social media where I got a platform to express myself and serve my opinions. I get that feeling of recognition and acknowledgement for all of my questions and answers.,positive
I don't like when it force me to install the app when I read the posts from the notification received on email.,negative
I had previously rated this app 4 stars but after upgrading the app I'm not able to view my feed. The home page is showing my profile page instead with a no way out. I want to read my feed. Fix this bug asap and I'll rate five stars.,negative
Really awesome app... I'd give it a 5 star rating if it didn't have to reload all the time when I minimize,positive
"Used to be excellent. Now filled with useless questions, largely thanks to the Partner Program. Quora will die off if the program is not repaired.",negative
"Forced me to install, interrupting my reading with an un-exitable pop up in the middle of the article. This is the most aggressive form of bullying ive ever seen from a web page.",negative
"Extremely good and helpful, guidance always to find more than optimum solution . Greatful to Quora for all benefits.",positive
The website is great but the fact im forced to leave my article to download the app only to lose what i was reading. Guys seriously whats the point. I hate having apps on my phone that only serve to annoy me with notifications. Download the app on to delete it in under 24hrs ? Please i respect your site and forum but Reddit saves me more time,negative
"App is not as per the standard. It crashes multiple times. You do not get full features one would need to write. You can not open dual tabs. Once you open the app again, it refreshes and the previous answer is lost. Font style and overall experience is not smooth. Once you get out of the app to search a new word you have read, and get back, app goes in the silent mood. And without any warning the app says service is overloaded, come back after some time. In short, it is irritating.",negative
The community has become extremely toxic and now people just post clickbait images in their answers just to get more view. Not that it's something new but now 8/10 answers are like this. Also really hate it when my questions get merged after getting thousands of views.,negative
The site is a great platform for sharing knowledge but please do not force us to frequently upgrade where nothing is new or at least let us read feeds via browser,positive
"I don't like the new update.. Im 28 , Its very difficult to read , eyes strain too much , letters small ..i want the old one ..",negative
"Quora is a great forum for education and sharing. I love to post/answer anywhere, anytime. App is a great help.",positive
Mostly I use the web version. OVerall quora is a great website/App to ask your questions. You can get lot of answers from different people across the globe. It really helps to get connected with lot of different experiences and to read the stories about different people from different ethnicity.,positive
"Quora is only meant for useful data. The articles are so worth reading. I make sure I am learning something new. Moreover, Quora is much like a informative app. You study, get motivated, are updated, gain knowledge. Honestly speaking I was a social media addict. But the time from when I have started using Quora it has helped me detoxicating from useless apps. I recommend to use this app over other useless application.",positive
"I love this app. It's so useful especially if you are a student and you have curiosity and you want to explore the world, this app is the best to ask questions‚ù§",positive
Can't connect to internet. Problem occurring for 2 months. Not yet resolved. Uninstalled. Never installing again,negative
There's absolutely no point in forcing your mobile website visitors to download another sparely used app. Please add a close button to the annoying popups.,negative
Didn't like the font change in new update. Please revert back to previous serif font.,negative
"I just love it. Through it i get many great ideas, thoughts shared. Its food-stock for brain",positive
The app behaves so heavily processed and so slow while adding a question. Adding a question feels so stressful. Instead i go to a web browser and add my question,negative
Fine and very good app to get better idea and solutions for questions... It helps to analyse and take proper decisions for problems.,positive
"Fun and entertaining. This app is "" Chicken Soup for Everything."" If you have things going on in your lives, Quora is the perfect site to release everything. Its theraputic, and entertaining.",positive
"Occasionally I find interesting questions with relevant answers to those questions, but many of the questions are very juvenile or gossipy trash that panders to the uninformed and baser instincts. I don't have the time to filter through the nonsense to get to the worthy content!! Uninstall!!!",negative
Nice. I had a lot of wonders and thoughts that were answered clearly when I used this app. I also enjoyed the experiences that I read in Quora.,positive
Please chane the font of the App back to Serif. This Sans Serif font is very hard to read and makes the app boring.,negative
The overall content of the app is too good. And I would like to thank all the active editors and readers for their participation.,positive
"Hi admn. Quora app on my android not working. I reinstalled few time as well as restart cell phone many times. But only showing ""can't connect to the Internet"" now what I can do.",negative
I indstalled this app and when i select my email then it show the message that can't connected to the internet even i connected with internet so fix it.,negative
Very worst app can't ... I meanüò£üò† all are not in order that will put us in confusion answer to your quota will be in late response... That's it..,negative
"I would love the app and would love to rate it 5 stars but it is so glitchy and it's so bad that I can't even get through one sentence without a freeze-up. This app freezes my keyboard and locks my phone up everytime I start typing an answer. The app is updated and so is the software on my phone, along with any other program/software needed to successfully run an app. I love the website, but I'll have to delete the app until the bugs and glitches are ironed out.",negative
I abandoned my quora account once just because of this app. First it was forced on me. Second it works horrible beyond words. It's easier to work on quora through browsers. But problem is quora won't let it. So screw it. I'm done with quora and this disgusting app.,negative
Why it forcing me to download the app when i access from the web. The choice on popup only have one answer to download the app.,negative
"Few years back this app was like, great source of knowledge and having great articles in it but now a days , in its home page it has nothing to offer more than lust stories",negative
I don't know why the app is not running on my device. I have try uninstall and install agin. But the problem remains same where there it is. Please help.,negative
Bad experience.when I click any quora link from my chrome the app shows up some other content.,negative
"Within a short period of getting into QUORA , I was delighted. Looking forward for enlightenment.",positive
"The bots on this site are pretty terrible. I had my questions be repeatedly marked insincere by it until I was later edit blocked. Then there's also the fact that there's too much entitlement on this, everyone feels like they know the right of way. Your question can be easily be marked because people on this jerks and the mods don't actually check the questions.",negative
This app is good only for viewing answers. The quora moderation can collapse any good answer or comment of yours. But it doesn't delete the adult and obscene content of other authors. Absolutely disappointed.,negative
"I was forced to download the app, the popup won't let me read on the web browser. You need to fix this soon quora.",negative
"This app is really amazing..... It allows people to share their personal experiences, thoughts of life.... Which are really helpful",positive
Horrific the app is offline most of the times . Reaching through browser is a better option,negative
"Quora is good, but its app is the worst. It often takes 5-10 seconds to respond It gets stuck in the editor. Basic features regularly break on update like being able to link images. Functionality from the web site is missing like visibility of answer drafts. Use the web site instead.",negative
Follow correct people and correct/desired topics and see the magic of this app :) Really good to keep learning something new everyday.,positive
"so many bugs. Sometimes freezes. Often lags. Tapping a button often leads to a different page than intended. Scroll once through and you're guaranteed to experience at least one of the above. Quora is a great platform, just not the app.",negative
Really enjoyable..i especially love the wide range of information and topics as well as getting to read about people and their stories.,positive
Content doesn't load in app when the connection is spotty. Frequently doesn't load new content and gets stuck in loading during mobile connection.,negative
Won't work with old version and won't load new version. I use to like the stories. Oh hum.,negative
Quota is an amazing source of interesting information. Sadly it is also used by some very young people to cheat on their homework.,negative
The best place to get an answer to a specific question you may have. Gets you to an answer much faster than internet searches which are more generic or off topic.,positive
It's really horrible that you guys forcing us to download the app and not letting us use the web version. You guys deserve 0 stars.,negative
Although I like the app very much it is very slow on Android version for some reason. Unusable; takes more time to answer questions than necessary and becomes a waste of time.,negative
Its the place for intellectuals and actually people like me who want the answers to so many questions popping in my mind and I could ask no one and got the answers also..interesting place..,positive
"I love quora for all the answer they give to questions I have, and the make the experience easier and faster.",positive
"Always blocks the content WHILE you're reading, asking you to download the app. But when you already download the app and you're reading from your email quora digest, it still blocks the content asking you to shift to the quora app. But IT DOESN'T LOAD THE ARTICLE YOU'RE READING ON THE APP. IT'S SO ANNOYING........",negative
It is good platform to learn and enhance our knowledge in our respective fields or interest.,positive
"I have spent more time reading answers to interesting questions on Quora, than any other internet activity lately. There are some pretty stupid questions, that look like students looking for homework help, or asking questions that could be answered with a 30-second Google search. I really do enjoy the personal experience stories, especially the law enforcement ones.",positive
"I always visit quora first, before taking any decision in my life,since already there are some people who have gone through it and have expressed their experiences. Its one of the most importent app in my mobile's app list.",positive
I enjoy giving answers on topics I am very knowledgeable about. It's interesting learning about different topics that I want to know more about.,positive
"It is annoying, as it constantly pulls up a window or something about completing profiles or if you just go online then it pulls up ""just use the app!"" Very annoying",negative
"Found this app by accident and cannot stop reading the posts! Hours and hours, trying to convince my wife to get it as well!",positive
"This is the smartest and most well rounded ( due to the diversity of members) that I have found on the internet. I am so glad I asked a question that instantly directed me to Quora. Thank you all. In this brief time, I have expanded my knowledge and my desire to learn.",positive
Nice app. Keeping one star on the rack as there is still a lot of scope for moderation of content.,positive
"Good, except for the Quora Partner Program. It was intended to pay people to ask GOOD questions, but, in practice, it encourages people to spam Quora with questions such as ""What is 2 + 2"".",negative
"The app provides us answer from best persons from all over world related to our topics. Thus it become easy to rectify your any kind of queries which may be social, political, technical, jobs, mental...etc",positive
Only downloaded the app to give it a one star since Quota is now forcing it's users to download the app without a choice. The mobile web version is no longer available as a pop-up alerting you to download the app keeps appearing and there's no way of closing it. I will be uninstalling soon after.,negative
"I like the app, but I wish I wasn't coerced into downloading it. I couldn't find the article I was reading. :(",negative

The app is too unstable. The website loads properly but the app can't open anything. Improve the app,negative
"Uninstalled! Nazi Attitude (-1000 Stars) They keep aggressively asking your Full Name, wont let ask a question even though I had my first and middle name updated but that's not enough for them, this attitude stems from a absolute position of ultimate compliance and control from all their users. I dont need you that much, seems like a Nazi regime behind the scenes or Hydra.",negative
"Though the app is best, they just destroyed a very good UI. Now every time I read an answer and press back istead of the feed it just exits me out of the app. Also the x thing is not appearing below evry answer which was really good.",negative
First I am a member of the Quora question and answer app. But like everything the app is an information blood sucker and if you install it you will receive emails from it and after hitting the link you are back for as long as it let's us to be. Yes I do mean unless you download their app even though it's them that sent me a link to the Site it will not allow to see your account for long. Also I don't think it can be a good idea to have a open door policy. Some questions are a bit silly but ...,negative
Not happy with new version. I am using quora since last 6 years but now app is Working very slow. It loads images very slow. The worst part is advertisment. You can find Everywhere in a short page. Not happy with that. You should try to let user to use this app not to show only ads.,negative
A great informative app. Highly recommended for the pursuit of knowledge and better understanding of topic's of your choosing.,positive
I love Quora! I just love reading all the different experiences from different people from all over the world. Also the different opinions and point of views. Not to mention if I need to know something that Google just doesn't answer right.,positive
This is one of the best app I've ever explored. I do highly appreciate/enjoy its extensive topics with academic/authoritative answers as well as active/meaningful discussions.,positive
Hey I tried to login with facebook into your app but it's not redirecting me anywhere.. can you look into this issue,negative
"I got answers to all of my questions! This app is really engaging, I'm always learning something new on the app, I liked the recent updates. The app runs much smoothly now. Happy with the app. :)",positive
"Overall, I am having a terrific experience. However, if I can't respond to a response to someone to my question then I would like to see functionality that allows me to Block people who Block my ability to comment on their response to my question.",positive
Looks good user friendly. But when we tried to ask questions most of the time we can't get any answers that easily,negative
I LOVE Quora!! Great app! Great info and stories about any topic I'm interested in. Hours of great reading.,positive
"I like the concept of quora. Various people represent their view and people get awareness from all the perspective. Even when experienced people give their views, it has great significance. The indespensible thing is to one thread i.e to one question, there are so many answers. Yes talking about quora app, its very smooth and very user friendly.",positive
I love this app! Fun tp learn and have a chance to share my knowledge to others. Happiness is key to life while insecurities and fears hold us back. I love to give back in hopes of making a difference in someones life. I highly recomend this to anyone craving knowledge.,positive
This is just awesome! We are able to understand the difference perspective of the people. Some of the stories are heart wrenching and motivational. Thanks for this beautiful concept.,positive
Every time I try to look at something the screen is gone with a pop-up it's almost impossible to read let me finish one article and I'll rate you how come there's no pop-ups on this one,negative
Amazing experience and it literally helps a lot to enhance one's learning skills ..just loved it,positive
"The Quora application was working fine most of the time. But since I have started using it regularly since two months ago, the Quora application has failed to load on two different instances. First time was about one month ago, and the problem lasted for about 7-8 hours. The second time is now. I still could not open the application. Please rectify the problem soon, thank you.",negative
It's a very good app but it keeps crashing. I can't even open it. I uninstalled it 4 months ago due to the same reason and now too am uninstalling it because of the same,negative
A good app for knowledgeüíØüìñüìöüìùbut be careful of what content you watch. Some contents are awesome but on the other hand some contents are of very low quality and of cheap mentality. And lastly writing answers on Quora can really increase your knowledge in English and make your English better and better good luck.,positive
Great platform to clear and get clarified... Simple methods explained makes the life easier,positive
I installed the app recently to try it out Don't install it it will ask for your real name apperently you have to scan your ID to them just to ask the dammed app when I had found out this I was scrolling through their answer on this not in some FAQ but a post had to find a user to tell me not them apperently they don't reply to email,negative
"It would get 5 stars if I wasn't pushed to use it. The UI is pretty good, but it just isn't familiar for those who use web version on both laptops and mobiles.",positive
"This app does not get along with SwiftKey. Whenever I attempt to multitask or even try to format and edit portions of text to publish on Quora I have to wait 20-30 seconds for the app to catch up, it then continues to throw the cursor wherever it pleases which means it writes over existing text. It does this often. The app is massively laggy when creating content and just bottoms out over simple tasks like navigating around text to edit it. Something we should be able to do in 2019 without lag!",negative
I would happily update my review to 5 stars if you could access the content where you left off. It's a pain trying to find where you were if you even find the article at all. I would think this would be a given.,neutral
It's a good platform to many trolls. As a Liberal I have no issue with tasteful nudity. A lot of nonsense questions over and over again ie should America take over Canada,negative
Unable to change my language from Hindi to English .. it should be user friendly where is it .. not in settings .. no where.,negative
"This has started freaking me out, the screenshots or graphical content is never completely visible on the app and that sucks, I try avoiding the app and use it online but it now redirects me back to app. Where the hell is that xperience u talking about. It just sucks.",negative
"These nasty a+holes keep sending me their lefty trashy emails LONG after i said to UNSUBSCRIBE me and i deleted their app. Also, their ""UNSUBSCRIBE"" button on the latest email is clickbait slime that DOESN'T take you to an unsubscribe option. GOOGLE PLEASE DUMP THIS SLEEZY APP. Thanks!!!",negative
I hate the fact that I was forced to download this app . I browse on the browser as I find it convenient. Every 5 seconds they pop up 'download quora app' and there's no option to shut the banner. I hate this forced promotion. Something I never expected from quora,negative
I love the app.. Very informative and really the con tributors on this platform are from all walks of life giving a pool of awesome responses,positive
from mail if i click on answer link it opens the home page in app. in browser i get popup askinh me to download the app. no way i can read the answer. fix this. its been there since a month now.,negative
Best app I've seen to learn new things by random. Always interesting questions and answers. Very responsive user base.,positive
I absolutely love this app! It is hands down the best app to use when searching for an answer or asking a question that has not been asked yet. It's platform has a huge population of members that can offer insight and expertise from all areas of professions and from all over the world. It's a great social platform and a must have in your app drawer!,positive
I really enjoy what is put out there as a question for us to answer or to read what others who think they are bright or witty enough to make a paragraph or two on the subject at hand. I so enjoy the answers. This is one of my favorite apps. I so hope it doesn't go away... I need this. I am home all day. In bed or sometimes in a wheelchair but never outside but maybe once in a while. But this I really love it. So entertaining and educational.,positive
"Overall experience is good but it should have offline option, and downloading the answers.",positive
"It's quite annoying and irritating, to see the notification asking us to download the app to continue. I downloaded. But sometimes i like to use through Google. So stop asking us to download.",negative
"Great application for learning enthusiasts, and for thought provoking ideas and to explore new things ..",positive
"You think you will get more downloads if you redirect, and hide articles on website. I don't think so, Uninstalling Now",negative
"An app so perfect haven't seen any glitches till now. And as far as the content, for any of the questions you have the best of the answers answered... Perfectly. And the best thing is its not from any expert it's from knowledgeable comman women and men like us",positive
"So long as the people think that the great recognized scientist's postulates and suggestive theories are the ultimate edicts and decrees of science, and keep on recoiled about it, the scientific world will take another 100 or more years to answer many remaining un answered questions abuot the light, heat magnet, the electromagnetic radiation and it's wave and the source of energies. The Quora pl.open a new platform for it.",neutral
Get rid of the google smart lock. Would fancy me only if google allows a person to hold only singular account. But that's not the case. I have 2..one personal and other official. Plus stop asking to download the app every time I browse over mobile.. it kinda feel even better that way. Plus ur download and signin has issues.,negative
I think the developers fell asleep on the keyboard while programming this shitbox. So. Many. Bugs. Quora itself is great but the app is horrible.,negative
it is crashing after the recent update. Can't open it even after re installing it multile times,negative
"It is a useful app,getting lots of knowledge about unknown areas, getting solved with lots of queries of different field",positive
I just installed this app to write this: it is very annoying to harass mobile users with pop ops forcing them to use the app. Very unprofessional. Uninstalling the app now and probably never use the website on my phone again.,negative
"I am perfectly fine using your website. However, now after about a five second delay a pop-up appears asking me to download this app. I don't want the app and no matter what I click it takes me to the Play Store to download it. Even if I click ""I Already Have The App"" it still takes me here. So now the website is unusable on my phone. I downloaded the app just so that I could post this review. I am now deleting the app and will find a better forum to join. Shame on you, Quora.",negative
Obviously its a learning app. You can ask your questions and also you can give answer on your way. Perfect app for those People's who loves to learn.,positive
Great content but the app needs more work. Also a night mode is really necessary!,positive
Quora's email notification sucks. I used quora only to search for social related issues alone but the quora email notified about sexual related issues in my suggestion email. I haven't anything about this on quora but why it showed and it became an embarrassment for me in front of my office colleagues when I opened my email. Your email notification suck suck suck....,negative
"Quora asked me to add Hindi as another language. Although I have nothing against Hindi and I am a native speaker, I am just not used to using websites and apps in hindi. This has been a bug for while. That if you add Hindi to your profile by default it reverts to hindi. Quora needa to get its vernacular game right in India.",negative
It was cool app but it just irritating me while opening the app it asks me to choose interest even after choosing it was not accepting the page will same as same,negative
"Useless app. I preferred to use internet until i was forced to use the app by non removable popup. This app doesnt work and lags when even when other bigger apps work properly on my device. When i click on an answer, it clicks on an ad . Why? Clearly this was devised this way as i have never experienced these problems in any other app",negative

"Quora has been a God send. There was no one I could talk to about the abuse I was experiencing with a narcissist husband. It took me years to understand and then make my escape. The after affects were horrible, but Quora helped me put one foot in front the other in my quest to regain the innocence I had lost and collect my broken pieces. It's been some kind of journey. Couldn't have even started without Quora. I will forever be grateful. Sincerely, jai ‚ù§Ô∏è",negative
"Trash. Forces you to open the app each time you click a title and then when you do open the app, it loses the question you were wanting to view. Why do devs have a constant need to change things?? If it isn't broken, then don't fix it. It's like you decide that if you don't make it different, then everyone will arrive with pitchforks and torches demanding change. Sometimes you just need to let sleeping dogs lie.",negative

"App works fine but I am giving it 1 star because they made it almost impossible to use their mobile website by basically forcing you to download their app to see answers.

Been using Quora for over 10 months. I absolutely satisfied with its features and experience this far. Unfortunately Quora has a bug on my device.

Good app and great to pass time. The algorithm seems to repeat similar content too often and can get boring. I wish they had better content filters.,positive
"Fine for reading answers, but answering and commenting is frustrating. Often when I type an answer or comment, the phone freezes momentarily, especially after say a second time commenting with the same instance of the app. Often the cursor will jump back to where it was before I moved it to where I want it to be, and then I often end up deleting the wrong word, because I pressed backspace already. Also misses letters sometimes when the app freezes whilst I'm typing.",negative
Love this app very much. When I have any questions and not in my mind at first I open this app. Try to search and most of answer are there or you can get. that's why I love this app very much.,positive
The user interface is way tooo much complicated I mean using the quora website is much better hasle free and easy but this app is too much complex to use for a normal user like me the lack of instructions and bugs just add up to it,negative
No doubt its a good app to find the answers. But it is non sense first they ask you to log in then only they will show the answer. When u log in they ask you to download their app otherwise it will not work. NON SENSE,negative

"I loved this website until they forced me to download the app to read answers. Gonna download, read and uninstall. Not cool man. If I download it it should be because I want to. I was perfectly content on the website.",negative
"In fact I like this website very much it help me to learn and find currently words in the system . I'm a teacher at prince kiddies preparatory school, I always tell them to use this website and it will improve their standards of learning.",positive
"Quora's nice and all, but I don't like that I was forced to download the app to use on mobile instead of just being allowed to use the browser website.",negative
On the site there is a seamless flow of answers while on app we need to close and open every answer. Do not understand the policy of forcing mobile users to download the app than opening the website. This is ridiculous!,negative
Great app. Never knew about all the thrills and fun waiting to be discovered until I downloaded the app and peeped into it. I am hooked and can't let go. Every glimpse is like a man living in a big house and discivering a new door of treasure everytime. Thanks for the great app.,positive
"Had been a user of this crappy app for ages when i realised they have a worthless developer and there is no comparison between the website version and the app. This app only serves the purpose of pushing ADs nothing more and is a waste of mobile data and space. You can't edit or compose responses. App crashes frequently. Updates improve Ads and doesn't conform with privacy rights. Uninstalled and am at peace now. Simply switch the website to ""Desktop View"" to enjoy pop-up free Quora on mobile.",negative
"Dear Quota Devs, allow the users to adjust the font size inside of the app. I am reading a lot of posts on Quora, but my reading experience is poor. The font size used for the comments is especially tiny. I have Nokia 6 that has 5.5' screen, and reading on the device of this size should be OK. Yet, it is not the case with your app. The design, usability and everything else is on point.",negative
"I wish i knew about this app longer. It's very useful and i enjoy reading different stories, topics on here. Thanks.",positive
"I enjoy it. Sometimes it can be like going down the rabbit hole, but it's a lot easier to leave than Facebook.",positive
"Since last couple of months, i am not able to access this app over my mobile data. I can only access it over wi fi. There is no problem with the mobile data as it is 4G and other apps like maps, Netflix etc work fine on the mobile data. There is no option in the app to seek support hence i am giving this rating hoping that someone in Quora would notice this and help me with my problem",negative
If this app worked it would be great but editing while you are writing anything is next to impossible. It is easier to type in another app and cut and paste because you can not ever finish anything inside of this app. It lags so bad and the keyboard freezes up and shuts and opens erradically. How hard is it to make a decent writing app? Really? Get it together quora tech people.,negative
"I hate this website and the app. Can't use the website exclusively without it forcing you to download the app. Upon entering the website, it automatically signs me into it using my email, which I strongly dislike. Couldn't give this app or it's unusable website a worse vote. Would if I could.",negative
Great app. I love the user friendly layout and ease of browsing. The search function makes it easy to find what I'm looking for.,positive
"This apps is really good to all but below age 18 is not safe to see this. You can get answers for all categories like education, fashion, romantic, sex related questions and answers including technology questions. I am really happy abd and enjoying this app and getting lot of information also.I appreciate this apps and they will do the service last long.",positive
It's very nice and informative app... I learnt a lot from this.. so many expert's are there to give a good advice to Junior's.. thank you,positive
It gives best information of any subject .It is really wonderful and fantastic.Enjoy the quoraand increase your knowledge different ways. Best of luck,positive
Unlock the full rating experience by not shoving your app down our throats and at least improving it for once. There is one more star for you if you let us use quora in our mobile browsers.,neutral
The worst site ever. Don't waste your time when there are way better apps just like this one but not as ridiculous.,negative
I think this is one of the best app which can help you a lot...I very satisfied with this and really every time whenever I wanted an ans or solution for something...QUORA always gives meüòäüòä,positive
popups for app installation is very annoying. Can't read articles. It forces to download the app.,negative
"The app is grossly inferior to the mobile site, and the mobile site keeps infuriatingly demanding that I install this app. I installed it. The mobile site continues to demand I install it. Even clicking the ""I already have the app"" option just takes me back to this page. Stop forcing me to use an app I'm not interested in!",negative
this website has really gone downhill lately. People who are obviously using a fake name/credentials are not at all bothered with...yet people with verifiable identification but choose not to give their real name have their accounts flagged for simply giving an answer people don't want to be true (why women who wear heavy makeup aren't seen as good leaders) real silly. ',negative
I love answering the questions. I understand that you get paid for the questions and not the answers yet. It's still a lot of fun. And you know your giving accurate answers. So you enjoy reading the others that also write answers or the questions.,positive
the answers to questions posed on this site are very informative/educational; you never get tired reading them. what a learning environment!,positive
"Only downloaded because you a**holes won't let me browse on the mobile site anymore without this damn app popping up, I click X, it brings me to download, I click already have it, takes me to download. Great UX......üôÑ",negative
"It's really helpful, a lot of info is flushed in it daily try to grasp as much as possible.",positive
Excellent and a really useful app to clarify our doubts related to any field!!Totally satisfied!!!,positive
The images always cut out in half. Sometimes it doesn't show at all. You have to click the blank space to see its picture.,negative
"It's a great place to get answers for the questions that have been bugging you, and keeping you wake. The answers come from a great Range of people and opinions. Some of the Answers Can be quick And Easy, And some of them can be long and wonderful. I started answering questions myself, after asking quite a few, And it's interesting to see how your anawers change as you mature. God-bless you in your search for answers.",positive
"Have enjoyed this app for years. New, interesting, intellectual discussions on whatever topic you wish are always being engendered. Highly recommend, but not if you are a Trumpster.",positive
"It is very slow due to which it is not convenient to read question which has 2 k answers.It opens slow,runs slow.There should be system like ""Moon +reader "" app has which has page system & it remembers where we were when we left reading.",negative
"Awesome app for readers, All types of contents are available and it is a best platform to get information. I would like to mention one thing please put some strict barriers or policies for posting of explicit contents.",positive
"As time wasting as it may seem sometimes... while reading you will actually learn a couple of things, throw in a couple of pointers yourself and just enjoy reading stories and posts in general especially when you do have some time to waste",positive
"After i successfully disabled all the notification because of the unimaginable spam, i kept getting more. Don't be a pain in the ass.",negative
"I think its the best learning app for me.People should use more time on this app rather than Facebook. Facebook, Instagram Is just waste of time.........",positive
Most knowledgeable app on web.we know from expert on the job experience & to the point answers.one less star because we cannot copy our favorite answers nor there is any method to make different folders of our favorites.,positive
"UI is good but I have some suggestions - Please add a dark mode! And in the notification and email settings, make the toggles easily accessible instead of having to go to each section and then toggling them.",positive
Its not working from last few week what am suppose to doo i like this app alot fix it as aoon as possible It says qoura is stoped when ever i try to open it do something about it,negative
Yes I really enjoy learning about Different Things when I first looked at this app I was not quite sure what to make of it Till I finished downloading. Then I Looked at the other parts it got to be Very interesting.,positive
Stop asking me to download this app when I'm on the original sight it's annoying af obviously I dont want to use the app if I'm on the website and you block me from reading anything and there is no way to close the question out on the phone when you ask it.......,negative
They have banned my account for no reason and without any prior notice. This is pretty frustrating. This was my was main source of knowledge and I used to enjoy it a lot. I hate it now. I am not gonna stop untill I give 1 star from 10k Google accounts. And I tell all of my relatives and friends to do so too.,negative
The share option to spaces is buggy. Cannot share an answer since the share button doesn't work. Please fix it.,negative
"It's a nice app,inculcating awareness ,knowledge and other related topics and providing the answer as well as seeking feedback for such answers,it's make others to participate and conquer the opinion on answers,given by others. It's excellent way of presentation, deserves appreciation. Kudos.",positive
It is very bad when I updated this app.... While reading something it's shows only half of the image and some time it doesn't show any image ...,negative
One of the best apps ever. An ocean of knowledge along with an interactive feature to clear personalised doubts about a particular topic. I enjoy this app thoroughly. Cheers to the team behind this idea and its implementation ü§òü§ò,positive
"Best user experience. Just one thing I find missing is, after some ideal time, it automatically scrolls to new feeds. It would be better to refresh feed only on user interaction.",negative
"It forced me to use this app, this attidude is extremely annoying, hopefully Quora makes an option to ignore this, I cannot install quora on every single phone i use. apart from that, the app is hideous, the chrome tab edition is much superior and can multi-task, needs alot of work",negative
"The content of app is good. But after they asked me "" do you know hindi"" and i answered yes, the app is forcing me to read in hindi. Further language change button is placed such that i have to spend considerable time switching to English. Good content. Bad app.",negative
"This app allows nice reading. It can be educational, comical and instructive. The range of matters dealt with is its asset.",positive
"Can't copy text, can't change font size, can't night mode. Can you just let me copy text cuz I'm learning English, many words I have to copy and search dictionary.",negative
"It just awesome. Some posts will make you, some will make you sad but thing is sure you will learn a lot of being a good person from others experiences and mistakes . So much fun way spend your free time.",positive
Recent years technology makes us to move away from each person....The real medicine for a cure is not only by the method of treatment but also by the kind words of a doctor...we the people doesn't care each other.we don't know who is the person living next to our house.I am not blaming the technology it's our mistake . This app is different from other apps it unites the people.It helps us to know each and everything. A small effort by someone which makes benefits to millions of people.,neutral
"It is a great place to share knowledge, experiences and is a great way to pass your time and an alternative to scrolling through Facebook ,instagram etc. Overall i loved this app and recommend downloading it.",positive
"I'm a smart person. Not only because of what I've learned in school but also because of things that I've experienced in my life. This app let's me feel like I'm helping people. I didn't give it 5 stars because it can be hard to navigate through content, and if you don't finish an answer it's hard to get back to the draft. Also, questions sometimes get grouped in with similar questions and it can really screw up answers.",positive
I keep getting notifications then whem I try to read the questions/answers it forces me to download the app. I dont even remember signing up for an account so why would I want the app? Tried it and it is utterly worthless. Cant comment without it crashing my phone then it is all but impossible to find what I was reading. Deleted the app and will be unsubscribing from the site just to rid myself of the nonsense.,negative
Only reason I have this trash is to write a review on it. I was perfectly fine with the browser version and not this garbage of a app,negative
"A good platform to learn, teach and inform other persons and oneself based various persons or personal experiences and knowledge.",positive
The app itself is probably great but why do they have to push it down my throat? I just want to answer questions and share my experiences so others can avoid making mistakes that I've made. The fact that I can only answer certain questions through the app bothers me. Who cares how I answer? Isn't the stuff all getting posted to the same place? Some of us are paranoid and prefer a website to an app. I don't need an app monitoring me. I prefer my incognito mode and a good browser.,negative
Has many bugs still. Crashes and freezers up many times while trying to answer or ask questions. Very frustrating!,negative
I don't want to download the app to read the content of a website but every five seconds a pop-up tells me I need to do so. Time to unsubscribe.,negative
Very slow to load.... Unresponsive many times. Thousands of bugs in app. Mostly suggest adult content even if i have disabled it from settings.,negative
"It is a way to learn everything here, and it will make your concept clear, amazing questions answere about all things too good.",positive
"The resource is just great, but as for 2019, this app is highly user unfriendly. Most prominent UX issues are already said, we just wait for you to tackle them. Good luck with that! It will bring more users, and surely will make current ones use it just as much as they wish they would use.",positive
I shouldnt NEED to download the app to continue browsing on chrome when i can see behind the prompt to do so that the webpage has loaded completely fine. Other than that its good.,neutral
"Best place to share knowledge, understandings online. One can enjoy writing and reading and huge audience. I am enjoying it.",positive
too much ugly experience it doesnt allow us in reading article from the website Forcing us to download app.,negative
Great app! Love the access to so much info on such a broad range of topics.,positive
"Apart from its slow messaging service, everything else seems just perfect for me.",positive
"Gave five star for the purpose this partocilar network solves and so far I find it the best in its category, but, the android app is buggy, slows down the keypad and shuts down every often. I don't know, where lies the problem.",negative
It was most irritating app i am using quora on websites a pop up dialog box and there is no cross button to close that screen you only have option to download this was very very disappointing.,negative
"I like to see the world through the eyes of other people which is what Quroa does for me. I whish it was possible to change the font size in the app though. So, long ago I deleted the app because of the font size. Now it no longer works without the app. This app is terrible now,",negative
"very buggy since the spaces have been introduces. App freezes when i move the curser- like when adding a word mid sentence as i'm writting- also the edit answer function freezes, menus load slowly.",negative
There is a misclick issue that has not been resolved yet. Click one question. Another one opens up. It is frustrating.,negative
Most beautiful app for mature ppl who want to seek serious discussions and debates. Interface is much simple but bit scattered. There should be direct thread of answers under the question.,positive
Get excellent personal views and experiences on different subjects from all over the world.,positive
"Forces to install the app this didn't feel good when we are not interested to install the app when we had to read something in urgent. If you are providing an web service and also this app, those who are interested will surely install the app but you should not force them.",negative
Fine place to know and tell about whatever you want to. Think of any topic you will get it here. You can also use it for leisure. Just read interesting topics of your choice. Quora is simply superb.,positive
"This app is becoming soo problematic... You open an answer, it loads and boom wine other answer opens up.. You try opening the answer it doesn't open you click it doesn't open so you scroll down and boom answer opens twice.. Do something about it",negative
Recognise your where your audience needs your stuff. Dont keep prompting to open in app without giving any options to read it in the browser. Make your app perfect if you are forcing people to download app,neutral
"The website and content are great, but the mobile site forces you to download their app to continue reading. I'm not going to do that and will in fact be using the actual site less often.",negative
"I LOVE THIS APP MORE THAN MY TAUREAN SELF‚ÄôS FOOD! IT‚ÄôS BOMB, DYNAMITE, AND FIRE EXPLODING ONSTAGE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS APP.",positive

But content won't get loaded properly. We have to refresh again and again to view answers in detail.,negative
I was quite literally forced to download this app. it crashes all of the time.,negative
"Screw you, quora. I just want to read this story about a hospital not allowing parents to interact with their dead baby, but no, it's too far down in my browser and you won't let me see it except in the app. That is the only reason I downloaded it in the first place. Y'all happy? I downloaded your freaking app to finish reading about how this family coped with fighting to see their dead baby. Leave. Me. Alone.",negative
"Highly informative.. information from different people hardly conflict... great app...still searching for improvement areas,haven't found one yet...keep it up",positive
"Don‚Äôt work my phone, always show not internet connected but already connected. Worked this app 2018 but now really not work as well before....",negative
This is the worst app...first you are forced to install the app and then you find it that it's not even able to function normally....no more quora please.,negative
"Horrible. Same complaints as others. Forced to download app bcuz it cant be 'X'd out. When trying to download, it doesnt! Very irritating when im trying to read a response or write one. It freezes. Please fix this! I love this site but its hard to not get annoyed and just shut it down!",negative
The app is pretty well designed .. just one thing can you add a dark mode like pitch black mode so we can read peacefully at night without getting blinded it would be really appreciated,positive
"For creative problem solving, you need a variety of perspectives, and that's what quora helps with.",positive
"The app is far from smooth. Bookmarks are not shown on the home page after the last two updates. Furthermore, after pressing the read more button post searching for a topic, you cannot go back to the previous page and have to search all over again, the q/a changing in the process. Quite disappointed.",negative
Great for following threads of interest and finding new interests. Like shouting questions into the void and getting great answers back.,positive
"Very awesome app. Write, search topics, ask questions, answer questions, read interesting true life stories. I love it!",positive
"An app that suits all our doubts and questions. Truly this is a one-stop place for those who are never tired of asking questions. Further, the questions that are asked gets answered by a diverse set of people who being new insights to the question with their answers. I love the fact that the app, like Wikipedia, is a community effort and thus very efficient.",positive
"This website FORCED me to download their app or prevented me from reading the remainder of an article I was halfway through. I like their site but hate when people try to trick, coerce or force users to do what they want. I DID install this, just so I could leave a 1 star review and am going to then uninstall the app immediately. Not going to be forced.",negative
One of the best example of creativity in modern times... it is really addictive .. i just love this app... highly recommended to anyone who just loves reading and sharing,positive

"This ap is incredible. I love the diversity and maturity of different perspectives, opinions and feelings. Its like being in college all over again. Different religions, races, socioeconomic backgrounds.. intelligently and politely hearing out and being heard..",positive
One star because they made me download yet another app to view content that is perfectly fine on mobile browser.,positive
I had been learning various of things from this app. It's very useful and tempting enough to adjust.,positive
"The app is extremely unstable and keeps crashing. It also automatically disconnects my WiFi. 10/10 for content, 2/10 for performance.",negative
"I have the app. However when opening a Quora link sent via email it's opened on the browser. Then I get a pop-up asking to download the app. I can't dismiss it. I click ""I have the app"" and I'm sent here instead of opening on the app what I'm reading. Quora is therefore unusable.",negative
A place where we can find wonderful things in internet and use internet for a better purpose. Quora has teached me a lot from life to Programming.,positive
This ap is more used as political piblicity.kibly give us fair explanation or dont show me the revelent questions and answer as per the app. All I can see is all party making their pitches. Actual information is midsing,negative
"I love the app, but seriously, I haven't experienced an app this slow since 2010 !! Please fix it and I'll change the rating.",positive
I'm giving one star because zero isn't an option. I don't want this app. I don't need this app. Bit the main site has stopped working because it seems to think I do.,negative
"The web browser version worked fine until all these pop ups for the app started coming every time and make you lose the feed. If you cave and download it, now when you read on the app it's super glitchy to the point that it crashes and you constantly lose the feed and can never get back to the question you were halfway through reading. Extremely disappointed. All the user content is great, delivery system sucks.",negative
So far the only problem I find is that there is no dark mode and this app does really chuckle even when there is sufficient data to run a video on YouTube.,negative
It's a very good app where you can gain a lots of idea and enjoy a lot. It will help you to pass your time efficiently,positive
"Unlike any other Q & A forum in the best possible ways! The most useful, informative and accurate place for self exploration!",positive
Nice app.. but you are always merge many questions to completely non related question... And why don't you send QPP earnings to PayPal personal account? Is there any necessity to open business account for that.... Which is difficult dude.,negative
"Horrible notifications. Completely out of sync to when they actually happen. And even after seeing the notification in app, 10 minutes later the same notification will be shoved down my throat in the notification bar. Also the app feels very glitchy and heavy. Terrible app, great website.",negative
The font size is relatively smaller for reading. The former font size in the app was good. Please put a setting to control the font size in the app as per requirement. It will be helpful.,positive
Downrated because you forced me to download this app despite having a fully functional website which I prefer. Secondly because you deceptively sneak in ads within the content feed.,negative
"Low rating because the mobile site won't let you browse without the app. I don't want it, I just want to read questions and anwsers online.",negative
Forced to use app to read quora articles. Links dont open as they are unsupported by the app. Really disappointed as I loved using quora but its more hassle than its worth now.,negative
This app is really really really good but it needs a lot of optimisation and a new interface!!!!!,positive
"Lots of options on posting, reporting, and hiding irrelevant or questionable content. Developers are generally responsive on errors and (sometimes) suggestions. The current build is much more stable than previous ones.",positive
Best platform to share personal views and experiences. But didn't got invitation to partner program yet.,neutral
"Dear developer, I am not able to load some specific answers on quora since the latest update. Please have a look into it and solve this problem üôèüëç",negative

It's an great experience to come across new question some of which made your day or remind you about some extremely funny moments of life and many more I totally recommend to download it..... #proud to be an quorian....,positive
"I've been a Quaran for years now, and used to read it daily. In the past 2 days, though, it asked me to join 5 spaces, then gave me a few options (all of which I have zero interest in). I caved and chose 5. My home page now has NOTHING but questions from those 5 pages. Sorry, Quora. You used to be an excellent way to get sucked into reading for a couple of hours. But if all I'm allowed to do now is to read nothing but ""spaces"" pages you forced on me, I'm walking. I've already deleted the app.",negative
These real life experiences are simply the best stories to read. A great break from the news!,positive
"Almost always interesting questions followed by even better answers from every walk of life. Fun to read, sometimes sad, but lots of learning and perspective to gain for yourself,your tribe of all forms of life, and whorver has to read and edit everybody's everyting.",positive
It is a nice platform to share the experiences and knowledge which can enrich and help the needful,positive
Always ends up reading more than I intend to. But the things in Quora improve my knowledge and give wider perspectives of the society. Good app!!,positive

Best app for suggestions and useful for those types of person who stuck in an adverse situation. They can take advise from the former one who crossed that stage..,positive

"They force you to download the app, and after i download the app, i couldn't find that exact answer that i was reading. And whenever i click to upvote an answer, it clicks on some random ad, i dont know if this is intentional or its happening with just me, but its really annoying. I am uninstalling it, and will never use Quora again.",negative
"I love this app!! Intellectual content for when I'm yearning to learn at stupid o'clock in the morning, silliness when I want to pass the time and heartwarming when the need calls. And I can share my knowledge, thoughts and experiences if appropriate. It's like having your mates with you when you're alone!!",positive
"I like Qoura , It's really a good app, where you learn and share what you learned so far. Good initiative.",positive
"Stop forcing me to download your useless app. Bad design, bad user interface and mostly bad questions and answers. I rarely open quora now (because of the degrading quality of content and UI) and now you guys have started giving me problems when I rarely use it too.",negative
"I'm learning quite a bit, I hold an associate degree in contemporary history from my local community college and I absolutely love this site and it's members. You guys are better than porn!!!!",positive
The app is total garbage. Filled with glitches and bugs and freezes my phone regularly. But the site now won't let you read answers without the app. Way to treat top contributors.,negative
"Forced app, while browsing on quora website, it randomly forces this full screen prompt to install app and cannot be closed. Installed just to give one star rating, thank you for ruining quora, uninstalling now",negative
"I like it, but it's a little argumentative and repetitive. I'm rating it a three, because whenever I try to open a link from Facebook into the app, it doesn't open to the correct page, and it also forces me to eventually install the app to keep viewing content instead of allowing me to view from a browser.",negative
I love this website. Just rating it 1 star because how this website forced me to install this app despite of having an account the website wont let me view things without installing the app. I freaking dont want apps that I only use occasionally. It should be up to me whether i install it or not. If it was an app only service why do you still have a freaking website!!,negative
"I don't understand why this app is full of bugs when the iOS Quora app isn't. This app is ok if you just want to read, but unusable if you want to write answers. Regularly freezes while typing, frequently unable to move the cursor to the desired position. And various other bugs make it absolutely impossible to write or edit answers.",negative
Its good app....but it doesn't provide a dark mode for night....it will be much better after that.,positive
"lots of incredible, interesting, educational, confusing, inspiring, humorous, saddening, informative content can be found on Quora. if you dont find a space that speaks to you on Quora how utterly shallow and boring you must be!",positive

"Quora, you should stop forcing people to download your app when people can use the Website on their mobile browsers. It is really irritating when that app banner pops up in the middle of me reading an answer. I don't want to download your app.",negative
When I search a topic and go to check any answer on its feed pressing back button throws right back to home page. So I have to keep searching again and again. That's absolutely rubbish experience,negative
"Most fascinating source for historical/ trivia info... particularly ancient history, which is my particular interest...",positive
"I am a total fan of Quora but the app, not so much. Looking over some of these reviews, I find I am not the only one who has lost a long written reply when the app glitches! I written out a great reply, (in my opinion of course lol) and it freezes, glitches, and BAM disappears into on line neverland, never was, never could be again! It just happen to me! TWICE I tried to reply to 1 comment, a well thought out and lengthy reply, just gone! After years with Quora, frustration won you the review!",negative
It makes compulsory for the user to view details in app when it gives two option open in app open on mobile site after clicking on mobile site then also it redirects to app which is rediculous!,negative

"You guys need to fix the navigation. When I go to specific topic, I want to STAY in that topic. However, if I click a question or answer, and then click back or the 'X' at the bottom, it takes me out of topic and back to my feed. This forces me to navigate back to the topic I was just in. It's quite aggravating and I'm finding myself using Quora less and less as my feed is filled up with suggested questions and topics I have no interest in.",negative
"I wanted to use the mobile website for browsing, but the pop up forced me to download. Pressing back button closed the website all together. Giving no choice but to download the app which I don't want to download. Scumbug developers",negative
It works fine if I just read the suggested topics but if I choose one topic and read one answer and likes to see few more questions it again goes to the search page and I have to come from first.,neutral
"Now that you have added more light(white) to the theme and look of the app, so please add dark mode to app and website like Reddit.",neutral
Quite Slow guys. Make it fast. It also gets hang while writing long answers.,negative
Won't let me access the web version. Forces me to access the app version. I hate this.,negative
Forced to download an app in order to read an answer to the question. Not appreciated. I didn't want to download an app and preferred to browse the website instead.,negative
The app was great until it stopped allowing me to write questions. I followed every policy including making my questions short and clear and even using my full name. I just wanted some advice and they simply didnt let me! So incredibly frustrating.,negative
"Consequences. The browser version worked perfectly fine. What's the point of having a browser version in the first place then, if you just spam your users with disruptive self-advertising. What do you even gain from it. You can have an award for f*ing over your own user base.",negative
"They're even more Nazi Germany than Facebook, but not as bad with the punishment. However, annoying when you think your argument was great and there was one little word that can be taken out-of-context--yet the post is gone... Now you either have to type it again or settle with the world not knowing the wonderful rebuttal to the terrible troll.",negative
"Its has become an hobby for me to scroll everyday .One of the best app .Best way to convey you experiences,knowledge and share as well.You can get advice from experienced people .Iam a Quoran.",positive
IT WAS BAD! IT was so glitchy like somtimes it would crash i saw this on tik tok and wonderd but this was horrible...,negative
"It forces me to install the app while reading on the website even after having an account online. Honestly, the app is rubbish and no option for black theme. Most of the time it crashed. All the contents are awesome. No complaints about content. Totally disappointed by the app.",negative
"Don't force me to download this stupid app, I'm 100% satisfied with the website version. Now I can't navigate properly without a popup forcing me to download the app! I'm deleting the app anyway, only downloaded it to rate it 1 star. I lost interest in my question too.",negative
i love quora but i al giving it 3 star because after update it has become very painful for me to search the topic of my interest. Before update i were able to add whole topics in spaces which makes easy for me to navigate any topics without wasting so much time. Now in spaces i can only add a subtopic from a topic which doesnt fulfil my requirement. plrase fix it or i will look for any other plateform.,negative
"App with beautiful ui and easy to use, Meritorious. ‚úåüèΩ Also please control the content or questions, asking or demanding for upvotes; People ask questions just to gain popularity via Upvotes with stupid questions that hides the main informative question or answers. I had left fb years back because of unwanted contents for gaining popularity, so please make sure, users don't make this app the way fb is these days. üï∂Ô∏èLet me try this update...",positive
Forced to download app. Website refuses to let me read on mobile without abnoxious popups telling me to read on the app. App is glithy so I deleted it after reading what I wanted to read.,negative
"Very very good app, which not only improves knowledge but also tells what is what who is who and unbiased openions of readers and also past and present circumustances in india and around the world.",positive
"Good, so many good and realistic answers which we won't get from any where else.Most of the answers are educative also.",positive
"Quora is really a very nice, interesting and informative app. Information is shared over it in a very interective manner. It keep us active in the society and social sphere and we come across several intersting stories that people share on it. I would like to suggest people to spend their time on quora instead of facebook, whatsapp, etc.",positive
A nice app but day by day becoming less relevant as a lot of casual people use this platform for useless questions which wastes lots of time.,negative
Moderation policy needs to be updated big time. A platform for free speech and expression cannot be stifling those very elements.,negative
Only downloading this cause I was forced to. The internet one worked fine. Then they put pop ups forcing you to download there app,neutral
Installed app just to leave a 1 star review after popups to install the app made using the website unusable. Deleting app and account.,negative
"Stop those irritating pop ups please. You have to understand that not everybody have space in their phone to install an extra app when they are very happy using the browser. Come on Quora, grow up!",negative
"It covers almost all subjects, questions and answers from differnt parts of world. Really enthusiastic and much useful. Helps to know and enrich the information in the loved subjects.",positive
"Can't browse a topic as everytime I press back or the x button to close a question it sends me right back to my home page. The bookmarks bar is complete trash and never shows the topics which I wish to keep, and instead only shows spaces. Bookmarked answers often disappear and when I switch to another app briefly before going back, it refreshes the whole app, and I can't find my old questions.",negative
Nice but time wasting questions be sorted and not allowed like simple mathematic questions and questions of word's and theirmeanings.,negative
"If Quora have a website, then why it does not allow to surf it there? It always want to redirect to the app, which is the biggest demerit it have. Adding to that it is turning more like a social media platform full of memes, rather than a legit questions and answers.",negative
Disrupts continuity while reading answers in the browser version with pop ups for downloading the app. Even if I download it I have to search for the question again. Super annoying.,negative
"They seems to have updated the app, now it's lot slower, Things that hurts are 1: Ads loads first, content is loaded later. 2: introduction of links, please let us open them in browser or please don't introduce them. Half of the screen space is occupied with application containers.",negative
The great informative and life changing knowledge i get from this app.Reading on this app everyday improved me in lot of aspects of life. Everyone must have this app. Thank you so much for this.,positive
"Very useful, but it's really complicated and hard to look into a question. Lile if i click on it i see something, than i can click on it again and see something else, than i can click on it a third time and see something else? Also its hard to tell what answers relate to what question",negative
"Fun, though at times a little tedious, with several posters asking the same question, just worded differently. If your app doesn't have a filtering algorithm, I sincerely ask that you would please develop an algorithm redirect posters asking the same and/or similar question's to answer previously answered. All in all I thoroughly enjoy this app!",positive
"Hey, dear developer! This is really wonderful platform, which I like to explore! But, due to accessibility issues in this application. I unable to explore with talk back and screen reader softwares. It does not give full support with talkback. I think you must know very well, there are many blind people living in the world. Who are totally depended on screen readers and talkback ! If you fix these issues it would be really nice to explore. I hope it helps, thanks in advance.",negative
The images just vanish whenever i open any answer to read. I have to click on the blank space where the image is supposed to be to view the image.,negative
I love the concept of quora. But the app is very irritating. It is very unoptimized. Takes a lot of time to load . Old searches are lost. Very bad recommendation system.,negative
"Just downloaded and uninstalled to tell you I'm not using your stupid app to read your WEBSITE!!! That's what my browser is for! Not all of us have 128GB iPhones, you elitists! ONE STAR!!!!",negative
"Worst app ever!!! why do I have to login all the time when using it? there are few situations we are unable login. so, I hope devolpers will understand this make it easier for usage.",negative
Nice but the editor is hell. Hard to use to format text and slow in responding. This makes the experience on mobile quite unsettling.,negative
"Forcing users to download application is not good, well what to expect from Far Left echo center who are complete opposite of what they try to portray.",negative
"Qn &Ans app: 1Ô∏è‚É£ It's really good for shareing your idea, experience in words, images etc through Qns and Ans . 2Ô∏è‚É£U can connect people by upvote (likeüëç), shares, comments. 3Ô∏è‚É£U can learn in many areas incl academic, lifestyle, info, facts, thoughts, problems etc. 4Ô∏è‚É£U can get Ans from qualified persons like bank manager, doctors, med & engineer student, IITian's and so on. 5Ô∏è‚É£U can get Ans in your regional language, of course English is the major. ‚û°Ô∏è so I think u can try this according to need.",positive
When I was searching on website it forces me to install app and if pressed back button the page I'm looking for doesn't opening.,negative
Very bad app too much slow even after updating frequently. Really disappointing.y ou cant even check your writing until you wait for 1 min to loading,negative
Definitely the best way to get answers to your mind boggling questions and give back to the community by answering other questions yourself from other people. A really great solid 5 star social (QUestion OR Answers) app!üòé Really love it! It's really great! It's the absolute best at what it does! üòÄüòÅüëçüëç,positive
I downloaded this app because I was forced to do that.I can't use the site without downloading this app.I don't have any storage left.Please remove that rule,negative
i like this app and content i get to read is very knowledgeable and helpful. But i am rating it 1 star because of the annoying feature to install app pop-up in the middle while reading online and there is no option to prevent it. 18/10/19 again same problem appeared.,positive
Excellent app for people who want to know things from others. Very useful app to increase knowledge. You can see a question in all views by seeing more responses. Even you also can give suggestions to others in your strength area. Also it asks whether an answer is useful or not....,positive
Satisfying. But I think an article read history should be added. I keep losing articles I forget to bookmark üòî,negative
"Incredibly useful and fun too! Between the valuable information you can get, the huge variety of things you can learn, and the very entertaining stories that people tell, this is a great resource",positive
I don't want to use ....I like to use quora on my browser. So don't post that annoying non removable option to download the app. Let the users enjoy the quora platform whatever way they want to use. Don't be one of those site which forces user to stop using quora. I really enjoy quora ....please don't annoy the user. Fix this problem.,negative
"Good concept, good content but app glitches everywhere ???? Yes, that's happening in your app. And it's such a hassle to open the Quora via browser from PC while I can open it in app, but what options do I have if THE APP ITSELF DOES HAVE SO MANY GLITCHES ? Open the Quora via mobile browser ? That's imbecile solution to be honest.",negative
"1.When clicking on an answer the image loads half or not load at all. Above problem still exists after updating. 2. Cant browse topic. After opening a topic, and its post, pressing back button takes me to home page. Its frustrating to go to the topic everytime. 1 star for this.",negative
Useful app for a variety of things. Can find answers on many topics.,positive
"I liked quora a lot initially.But right now,I would rather not use it.I don't know what happened to the filters to remove explicit content.It became a softporn,semi nude site.Even for basic questions like fav screenshots",negative
I'm not able to see any of the bookmarked topics (as icons at the bottom of the screen) in the app since last one week. Especially after adding a space as bookmark.,negative
I love the quora website but this App is so much harder to use then the website and leaves out a lot of functions that were possible with the website.,negative
Great app. No accounting for some the morons who appear to be able write (not necessarily spell) who are subscribers. Not the best part of a representative republic - not a democracy.,negative
Well do for all subjects thank you. ever one can knowing easily . The usefull to all peoples. We can manged at any sutivations. Mostly usefull to sudents and also at the time of exams .busness peoples can use for improvement of tansactions .,positive
"Exceptional answers for basic and advanced knowledge. No ""personal"" opinion.",positive
"If only there was a way to browse the content offline, it would be great and very useful.",positive
"I havr an issue with th app it doesn't show the hiatory of what topics wr have read. If you have closed the topic it will nowhere going to keep the track or show back , i find the problem whenever i wished to comment a blog and press back button it goes to thr feed directly didnt stop at the blog place.",negative
"Great but it would be nice if the activity column of my profile had ALL my activity & not a random few. I want to see everything, upvotes, downvotes, questions & answers I've read(maybe). Recently, I apparently downvoted an answer in error & I wasn't done reading it. It was really long & impressive. I've TRIED to find it. It's so frustrating. I get what you might be trying to protect but I, the Downvoter, should be able to see IT! Note, the downvote icon looks like a download icon. Fix it.",negative
"In the early days, I found very interesting, entertaining and educational, and I love it, and then start question that somehow I feel obligated to answer it, I know no one put pressure on me, but somehow I feel that way, because you are been kind to me by gave me this QUORA. So I start answer a few questions, I do the best I can, but ( one) I have answer somehow miss intrepid and she said that I am ""a jerk"" there is miss understanding in there, but it was to late, but thank for this opportunity",positive
When I search a question in my net browser it answers perfectly but when the same question is asked on the app it shows no answer yet also everytime you try to click another answer in the browser it immediately takes you to download the app. Then why had you made the website.,negative
"The app is great but, the browser just dosent work anymore....they force you in every possible way to not use the browser and download this app",negative
"Absolute garbage of an app. Links keep breaking, images fail to load 90% of the times, and notifications keep refreshing themselves even after I open them. If you guys are gonna force people visiting the mobile website to switch to your app, at least make it decent enough that it won't break every 5 goddamn seconds.",negative
"They've now removed the bookmarked topics out from the home page and into some obscure part of your profile, defeating the whole purpose of having ""BOOKMARKS"".",negative
This app is amazing! If you really want to debate or make a point in a discussion - this app is perfectly suitable for you. Im giving this a solid 5 stars because it definetly deserves it! (Btw you can use this app in any device - it certainly does not have to be a phone),positive
"i only use quora to browse and its unbearable, cant seem to bookmark topics despite there being a button for it, so have to search it up every time, and whenever you click a question then exit out it refreshes and goes back to the home page, for an app with such a simplistic concept it has ultimately failed",negative
Many skilled persons are always available those who aer expart in individual modality. Quora answered me any of my asking in very good manner.,positive
Enjoy the reading and explore the knowledge and also able to express my valuable thoughts in written and share with others.,positive
Forces you to download the app in order to access the site using your phone browser. I would of just preferred using my browser to use the site instead of downloading an additional app. Deleting app after review.,negative
"It would be great to have dark mode, as other apps are also rapidly adapting it in theirs. Other than that, a fantastic application!",positive
"Iuse LG keyboard,Android; the only typing system I've ever used that's as bad as this app's was a flip-phone with some of the number keys broken. kept freezing up temporarily and occ. crashing whenever I tried to move my cursor and at random other times. when you start typing, even if your in the middle of a word it underlines everything until you press space, and, if you move your cursor away in the midle of a word, it stays underlined, and teleports back when you start typing. Autosaves though",negative
Forcing people to download the app by not allowing browsers to open it.. Highly irritating..,negative
"Hard to navigate, hard to add topics after the fact. I don't recommend it.",negative
"Doesn't open links properly. Half the time it just takes you to the front page, and the mobile site forces you to use it, showing an uncloseable pop-up telling you to use the app. I feel sorry for whoever designed that mobile site that people aren't even allowed to use.",negative
"Worst App. Those options which are easily available on quora platform are complicated in this App. I set my primary language as Marathi but still it shows only English language. I installed and uninstalled 3/4 times and tried to do the same. But not a good result. At every moment when I try to answer or read the App window pops up and asking to use Quora app. I am frustrated, if this continues, I may stop using Quora. Best Platform with worst App.",negative
"the app and website are great resources. and it makes sense that it would ask you to create an account to be able to read more than one thread. however, I STRONGLY dislike the fact that you're forced to download the app to continue to view other threads once you've created an account. like, I dont ever review apps unless I REALLY freaking like them, and had I not been REQUIRED to download the app to use the website, then had I decided to do so on my own accord, I would have given it 5 stars.",positive
"Quora app is good , usability is good, layout etc. The thing that is bad is that when you are writing an answer or a question for some reason the app responds soooooo very slowly for me on android . If I make a mistake and want to go back and correct it jeez. It's almost not worth it . It's so slow . It deletes the wrong part, highlighting the text is nearly impossible to get right first time. Really needs improvement.",negative
The compulsion to make the user download the app is annoying as hell. Most social media platforms allow users to use the website as well as the app.Quora doesn't allow you to use the web version.It is really irritating when you are trying to post or read an answer and the notification keeps popping up forcing you to download the app. This one star rating is only for this reason.,negative
"Quora Is Fabulous! I haven't been this excited about an app since I discovered Yelp. It's a question & answer type form that people from all over the world contribute to. The stories I have read have been so powerful that I've been brought to tears, laughed out loud and been totally inspired. The library of content is incredible. If you love to read / write, you need to check Quora out!",positive
Absurd! I would honestly give you 0 stars for this apps existence. Why are you forcing me to download this app through the mobile website with no way to close your pop-up it's infuriating. In fact I'll give you rap 5 Stars if you take that stupid pop-up off your mobile website!!! My whole core account is about to get deleted because of this app just sit on that I'm not the only one read your own quora questions and you'll find other users frustrated by this move. awful strategy for this company,negative
"I keep trying to read and answer the questions on the website but it wont let me. Its keeps referring me to download the app, even when i say i already have it. 4 stars because i like Quora. 1 star removed due to not being able to access the Quora website due to the app ad",negative
"After current update, i am not able to toggle between languages. Language settings are not working either. I am stuck with Hindi language.",negative
I have been using Quora on web for the past five years.Making it mandatory for the user to download the app is really cheap. Hope to see the change reverted,positive
Ok..so it's compulsory to install the Quora app. I was reading on my browser and the giant ads (with no option to close) flashed and forced me to install the app. So I sincerely installed this just to bring its repute down. I'll also tell all my friends to install just to give it one star. Thanks..,neutral
"I am addicted to reading these before I lay down for bed. Its like a bunch of cool short stories that you can comment about or even ""meet the author"". I LOVE this app!",positive
I really enjoy this app only issue I have had is when writing lengthy answers it occasionally freezes up and I lose it all not bad though,positive
14oct 2019 review updated with one star I don't want your popup messenge blocking me to install your app. It's annoying experience. I am better without it if you expect me to install app. -- Previous review with 5star It's really good and everyday they are upgrading themselves. At this point I find it more addictive than facebook.,negative
I love quora and the vast amount of knowledge base it has. But i love to use it in my browser rather in an application. But for the last few days i have been asked to install the application to see answers. This is forcing. I don't have any other choice rather quitting and look for other forums,positive
I don't want to install this this app but when i am looking for an information it always show a pop to install the app. Unable to see the query results.,negative
There is a restriction on expression. There is no specific timelimit for blocking you from writing or making comments. There exists underlying ego in moderation. A reader or commentator kept in dark.Too many ads in recent times. They have become more of irritation.,negative
The app will be much useful if the developer can add features like copy or cut.... Otherwise the app is useful,positive
"""is this link or answer usefull?"" Types of notification are irritating. stop it. If we find usefull shall be upvote answer. Feedbacks of link are irritating. I want to stay on one (let's say ""India"") while come back from any related answers. But it directly goes to search or feedback page... not good...",negative
Two stars till you enable dark mode. I want to open Quora while in bed at night and all I get is glaring white screen. So inconvenient.,negative
"App keeps geeting worse! I had to expand an article from a topic search but as soon as I tap on the big X bar to go back, it goes back to the list of searches. Dafuq!",negative
"I don't want to use the app! I just want to use the website, but it forces me to install this app. I downloaded the app just to be able to write this review. In the next minute I will uninstall this app again, remove my account from quora and get my information elsewhere.",negative
"Lots of interesting topics, experts, and viewpoints. I have got to get better at saving, bookmarking, threads, posts, I want to find again.",positive
Very useful and always informative. It is good plateform to learn by asking questions and reviewing ourselves from answers recieved. Resourceful to get enlightened!,positive
"It start my day with beautiful stories, real experiences, motivations. It give chance to explore other untouched areas, provides various facts, figures, reports, news, etc via various writtera. Love this App. :)",positive
Helped me to cover my syllabus through various teachers.If there would be more font option for the readers it would become somehow better. Thank You QUORA,positive
"Now the mobile website is unusable because of a pop-up that demands using the app. Which I do not want. So many times I stumble on a Quora page for some opinions, advice, guidance... I'm definitely not bothering to visit any Quora links anymore. Disgusting.",negative
"Wonderful app and informative too; however, my suggestive feedback would be to improve the sections of feeds and spaces. For e.g. my spaces and their relevant feeds dont show up until I myself get into those to check new feeds - a navigation bar on the top would be utmost helpful - there should be possibly an effort to improve recommendations - can we have a bit of clever AI involved to sort out and prevent showing duplicate questions",positive
"Useless app, keeps crashing, all it does is that it shows ads to the users",negative
So a reading app does not has dark mode when even play store has dark mode. Why arent u guys implementing dark mode.,negative
"Good platform with an average performing app, they have to redesign it and make it more lite and fast .",positive
Just one reason for this one star rating. I prefer using Quora website. Dont force me to download the app with an intrusive pop up. Who came with this brilliant idea anyway? Give that man an award. If your plan is to lose your consumers then you guys are doing a great job.,positive
"Freezes up a lot, really confusing interface, not a great experience.",negative
It contains a lot of positive stuff as well as negative also. So choose wisely which all articles u want to read and which all u want to avoid.,neutral
"When quora is opened on a browser, without the app, they force us to download. There is no close popup access... Its a bad ux . We cant read any answers ... This is vandalism. Wish i could share the screen shot.",negative
"This is an important app for solve our doubts, but it seems to quit complex, there is no order of content, please arrange the solve this problem and make the app more relevant",negative
"F***! As far as i knew,updates were to make the app more 'good',right?! But da f***,this app just,s***s more after every update! No topics in that belt below the feed,just spaces! Whenever i search a selective topic,and after reading the answer,press 'back' through phone buttons,it takes to that f*** digest,now tell me how am i supposed to access a f*** particular topic!!!!! This app.....is the WORST APP TO EVER EXIST! F*** you developers!",negative
"Very, very good and with useful current and old information around the world.",positive
"The services and community of Quora is great. But this app . I mean seriously, such a slacky slow UI , it feels like I'm using an app from 2011. Also in the recent update , they removed the list of topics which used to appear in the home page in the bottom. Why? Now I've to search a topic. Just improve UI , add dark mode , add options to change font and font size. Till then, bye Quora !",negative
Useless app with quora forcing users to download it on mobile to view the website. I am blocking your website from my network and never using it again.,negative
"When you read quota in the web browser it forces you to read some articles on the app, you press ok, the app opens and you cannot find the article anymore. Invasive and useless, I would give it 0 stars if I could",negative
Interesting questions targetting different subjects with answers given from people that are touched by their own experience and/or by professionals with their perspectives. I personally benefit so much from it. Right now it is more addictive than any other social media.,positive
Best app to keep one informed around the world on various topics that might be of interest to you.,positive
"Loved reading quora at night especially on the browser as i could go into night mode but now it started to show the pop up, forcing me to download the app. I would very much appreciate a dark mode option to the app as the current puts so much strains in the eyes and i personally don't enjoy it anymore.",positive
Amazing app! Vary useful if you need advice and another perspective on issues or questions you have like relationship issues etc. Yoou can search for answers based on the credentials and experience listed users list publicly and request answers from them directly.,positive
"Well I've always loved Quora despite soooo many other Social Media sites. It's simple, any question many answers. Above all there's a quiet not found anywhere else.üñ§üíúüíñüíü‚ù£üíûüíöüíõ",positive
"Each update the app fixes couple of bugs and open many other. In current update, unable to click ""Read More"". It does nothing for few clicks and suddenly it expands the answers for the number of times you have clicked.",negative
"Why is quora making it compulsive for me to see question requests in app on my browser page? I don't want to install the app. I happy with using it on brower. No option to get rid of the ""continue reading in app"" option. I would stop using quora if this irritates me furthermore.",negative
"The community on Quora is what I admire the most. And the only way of interaction through posts or answers is possible via the Quora website or application. I clear a lot of apps for the purpose of keeping my phone a little less clogged. With that in mind, if I want to browse any answer I am FORCED TO DOWNLOAD THE APPLICATION. I mean why? It's so pathetic of you people that I have to download an application for viewing 1 answer. TOO BAD. Disappointed in your service.",positive
"Has been continuously pestering me to download the app, so I downloaded it just to give 1 star and then uninstalled it. Made 5 more google accounts to do the same",negative
"Unlike other social media apps, this is informative, interesting and isn't harmful. At least not in any way I know!",positive
"I love this app! It's my kind of thing because before I make a decision I like to get every possible scenario on the table and choose from there. On the flipside, I also really hope sharing any of my thoughts and experiences helps someone else.",positive
"I am enjoying this platform. I dropped out of other social media (Facebook and Instagram). This seems to be a good place for sharing information. I do have one issue. In writing, my screen will lock-up frequently. I have difficulty going back into my writing to proofread (prior to posting). The shift key (capitals to lower case, constantly freezes). If I drop out of this platform soon, this will be the reason.",positive
"Just installed this to rate 1 star because of the constant pestering through pop up on mobile web version of Quora. I dont want to use the app devs, because I dont frequent Quora that much. Respect our choices. I didn't even open the app and here is your 1 star and now going to uninstall.",negative
"Poor experience, I get e-mailed a notification, of a topic, when I click to open in quora app it white screens.... So I open it in chrome only... I start reading away then get forced to open it in the quora app. On opening it takes you to home page.... Not what you were reading! Basic flaw.",negative
"You always disturb me to download your app with a pop up on your web page... if I want it,,definitely I will download..",negative
"The app doesn't even open. Worse, mobile site doesn't work well too.",negative
"Good app and idea, but no dark theme support means that you will get blinded in the dark at night.",negative
"Excellent app that utilizes the internetfor real good. Unlike so many manifestations operating for real bad in current times. Ihave not fully put in my particulars, photo, etc because I do not understand my way around the app. itself.where do I get a good tutorial on its purposes & how to operate it. eg how do I store Q &A's either in or out of app? At moment I am 50 yrs on from first yr Uni maths, physics and find explanations communicated by the likes of Alon Amit, Eckel Cifrese enlightening",positive
"The app was running good until they decided to remove the topics you are following from the slide bar at the bottom and bury them deep somewhere, made me use the app (and the whole website) less. - no night mode, how hard is it to invert the screen colors to facilitate night time browsing?! Apperantly very hard! Which led to less bedtime browsing and overall usage from my side.",negative
Buggy. Keeps crashing my phone (Samsung Note 4). And force closing. Otherwise a good platform.,negative
"I love the app because of the diverse nature of subjects, questions, and especially other users.",positive
They compell to install the app when you read second time on your mobile phone.what a cheap trick.,negative
"I didn't think I'd like it, and had no desire to look at it. I'm not even sure how it got on my phone. But I now look forward to reading it nightly! Wonderful app, it has quickly become my favorite!",positive
"Literally unbelievable how much personal info they give away - scumbag app that should never be downloaded! This app should never have existed, literally one of the scummiest things to ever hit the play store. Plus - you cant even use this app if you do.t give them access to your entire facebook - steer clear of this horrible, datamining app if you know what's good for ya :)",negative
absolutely. wonderful.! Educational a person can learn so much from sharing eventsvand true life stories.,positive
"This is a great platform which touches every aspect without boundations, very nice concept. Just that, more the relevant suggestions appear after search results, the better it will serve.",positive
Hangs a lot. Has cost me a lot of answers when the app crashed when I was almost finishing my answers. Talk pointers to different areas in the text has a transition of more than 5 seconds. It's very disappointing.,negative
"Decent with issues. Frankly a lot of tasks are simply easier with a decent internet browser. For example saving decent answers to questions. While using the Android app it would really be great to be able to simply save as a text file the good answers that one finds. Fumbling with ""sharing"" to another app that just simply retains a bookmark means that one has to find time again to go searching for what should have been simply saved as a file in the first place.",positive
"Controls go haywire anytime I am reading longer posts. I click on the ""read more"" and it opens a person's profile! WTH! It's the only thing that puts me off. Seriously, the developer hasn't noticed that? Good app with bad interface. Else it'd get 5 stars.",negative
When you open a link after typing into the search box you cannot return to the links from your search because they get erases. You have to return to the box and retype your info into the search box.,neutral
Despite being a very good platform for sharing knowledge People either intentionally or unintentionally are spreading useless and misguiding information.,negative
"Lots, lots, lots of slowdowns and freeze. Otherwise fine.",negative
"Why does the website keep forcing me to open the app, I uninstalled the app precisely for this reason, and have also stopped opening quora links cause of this. I open one link after a while and get reminded why I don't open quora links, smh.",negative
"The main problem I (and as I'm sure a lot of people) face with this app is the sheer number of totally mundane questions that are asked, questions that one can very easily just google to get the answer. These questions vastly outnumber genuine questions that cannot be looked up so easily, which makes it difficult for them to get answers. I would really love it if Quora had a filter that blocked out simple questions that one could get straight forward answers from a Google search.",negative
"I don't use it enough to have the app but when I do I just go in my mobile browser. This is more a review of Quora itself rather than the app. First, you can't really view anything without making an account if you don't already have one or you have to be signed in..which is kinda frustrating. The other is it makes you download the app....... there's no X to close out these prompts so I literally have no choice and it's really annoying. I just want to read some of these answers........geez",negative
I like to think of it as facebook for intellects. I am one who NEEDS answers about certain topics as well likes to give my opinion or share my personal experiences. This app allows both but on more of a personal level.,neutral
"I wish there was a history section so I can look back at answers/questions I've looked at, but apart from that it's amazing you feel like you're meeting the world!",positive
Terrible the app uses too much of my data and too much power causes my phone to die faster whenever I have it downloaded.,negative
"Please, stop trying to force me to download the app to read articles. I'm fine with the web version, thanks. Tame those pop ups!",negative
It is very informative n interesting.One can enhance his knowledge with the information provided by Quora.I like it very much .It is worthy of getting 5 stars.love it.,positive
Used to be good. Now it's just flooded with redundant and worthless questions about favourite colors and what would happen if the sky was green for a day.,negative
"What can I say! I'm lost for words! This app is like having a enclopedia, dictionary, computer, and a human brain in one! Very astounding, also interesting. Quora is way ahead of Microsoft, Apple, and whoever else wants to be put to shame; just haven't put it all together yet! I need to be President of their Marketing and Operations!",positive
Followed topic is not appearing under quick feed. Every time need yo search topic and then read once you select back all feeds would be gone and you are back on the search page so is no way to follow and search your interested areas.,negative
"1. It's almost end of 2019 and still they don't support split screen yet 2. Frequently getting ""Generic error"" when trying to open a link from within the app.",negative
"You have pretty good website which also opens nicely in browser. You compulsorily make people login via email to reply or post on that website is also acceptable. But you block away complete immediate browsing by displaying a non-movable popup box and then make them to download your app, is a $#!tt¬• thing. I don't care how good your app might be, it intruded in my reading so I had to download it, then login then revisit the google page to open the link in app. So giving a one star rating.",neutral
I like the stories people post of different situations. It's enjoyable and relaxing.,positive
Dreadful user experience! The user is forced to use the app instead of the very intuitive mobile web site. This would make a great case study in usability for what not to do.,negative
"Website works perfectly fine, but they stop you from reading it with unclosable prompts to download this app all the time, yet this app offers nothing beyond the website.",negative
"The mobile version of this app is full of bugs, it's better to only use the desktop version.",negative
"Please improve the app. It hangs up many times and donot work well in presence of good internet connectivity. For the partner program, you should give incentive to the people who give answers. Please provide a dark mode too.",negative
They always froce user to use through their app rather than on chrome I would prefer to have look at it just after my Google search rather than getting redirected onto the app...üò†,negative
"At first it was great, right now we have people asking irrelevant questions or obvious questions on repeat. Some answers are totally wrong or out of context. Still a great app for getting information from people who have experience or knowledge of various topics",neutral
Love the app but I give it 2 stars because it has one hectic battery drain. And also no dark/night mode. An app being so bright i would say needs a dark/night mode.,positive
I love this app but this app has a lack of function i.e. We cannot upload a question by click a photo. So I need a function so that a person can upload a question by uploading a photo instead of complex typing. When a function came into work then I will give it to 5 rated star.,negative
Amazing app!! Definitly recommend. I get so caught up in the app and waste so much time haha but it's so helpful and interesting,positive
"This is a product of an incompetent product management. Keeps conning users into installing the app, trashing the readers' experience over and over again. Ruins the diligent work of all good Quora contributors. Poor design, ghastly delivery.",negative
I really like Quora. It is an open venue for people to come with honest questions & gives the opportunity for them to receive honest answers. Of course there are also those off-the-wall questions & answers but that's part of the human package too!,positive
"I really love quora now i have to delete some important in my android phone, i just hope dowloading the apps would improve the articles & posts i am fond of reading. The negative comments has forewarned me of the every varying situatios",positive
"Every time it's updated it's another bug. And it's not possible to downgrade, I think Im loosing my time writing",negative
"Quora is a fine site. However changes to the site aren't communicated; the administration isn't transparent; Quora support/moderation is remote & regarded as clumsy & inaccessible. Also, this opaque shift to spaces, while a good idea, is exclusive; it's difficult to know how to apply, & risks limiting control of spaces to veterans rather than talented newer users. A related concern is the repetitive nature of some spaces opened by an in-crowd clogging Quora, & stymying future innovation.",negative
This is literally the last app on my phone that still doesn't have a dark theme. I really want to see a dark theme as an option.,negative
Recent update is very poor. That when we are searching something When we press back button on mobile It is directly going to home page instead of previous space Please resolve it as early as possible.,negative
Its fun to read and often has someone answering questions that show individualism.....thinking outside the box,positive
"There is a serious memory leak in the app. Writing a comment is fine until you try to place the curser some other place in the text. It stalls, then stalls. If you wait 20 seconds or so, the curser will eventually get there. If you're in a hurry like me, I'll crash it tapping all over in wonder how developers don't see this. This app has crashed my launcher. I would use the web site, but they've voided some functions in favor of this disaster of an app. Quora is a great idea, but tools are fail.",negative
"It is not as it used to be earlier. I can not see all the topics I have liked, it shows me only two to three topics which makes it pathetic.",negative
It is needed to install the app to use the website which is total BS. Idk why they made it that way but oh god please return it to normal. I dont have the space in my phone for every goddamn app on this playstore just to use basic functions that can work just as ease of not easier in the browser......,negative
Stupid app! Doesn't let me read on web browser. Keeps askibg to download app. I am NOT DOWNLOADING THIS APP. I AM ABOUT TO DELETE MY ACCOUBT ALTOGETHER!,negative
I lettrly installed this app because the window keept poping on their site and it was very very annoying and it can't be closed! 1 star review and i will delete this app after finishing my article! Poor attitude..,negative
One star because I was forced to add app. I don't like that. The browser / online site is easier to use with better features and options.,negative
Wonderful application for someone who's intrested in getting answers to their queries and also intrested in knowing the experiences of suave.!,positive
"I can't say that I'd recommend the app. It never successfully links from email notifications and it isn't as flexible to use, as simply opening in a browser.",negative
"It is a really good idea and it's obviously really interesting, but the app is horrendous, it glitches everywhere, the loading times are unnecessary long and the UI is TERRIBLE",negative
This is the worst app I have come across. I wish I could give it one billion negative stars so as to reduce its overall rating to zero or ............,negative
"i am a former quora app user and did not want the app today. You wanted my download, here you go. I will no longer use quora or receive emails now that you're forcing the download on people. Encouraging account creation, ok, fine. Not the app. I don't do blackmail. piss off.",negative
"Robust mobile application. User Interface is great, easy to use.",positive
"I can't read the text on the web page anymore without aggressive pop-ups telling me to install the app. Well, I don't want to! Off you go Quora to where Sun doesn't shine!",negative
"Only the first answer to a question is loaded. When I press on ""view more"" it keeps showing the three dots for eternity",negative
I do not want the app. I don't find it user friendly. HOWEVER I have also found that if I'm using Chrome browser on my tablet I have a limited window to read on Quotas website before experiencing an unclosable popup for the app.,negative
"I'm so thrilled to have found the Quoro App! It's way more than just being thrilled. Because it maybe the only thing that saves my life. I have found out I'm not alone , and have found so much knowledge from professionals and from people just like me with same stories as mine, I now know I'm not alone ! Thank you to all who have a part in Quoro!",positive
Images are not loading in the app. Contacted Quora developers and have sent the logs. Reset my device and still issue not resolved. Worst App.,negative
"When you type an answer, it mixes some gibberish and distorts the idea which the texts want to convey. Also, it closes unexpectedly and destroys your answer. Thank you.",negative
"Why am I being forced to use the app?? I search something in the browser and if quora has a related article, I'll go to it. But I can never open it in the browser. And even when I ""Open the App"" as suggested by the site, it never opens to the exact article I was wanting to read, thus making me lost in the infinite loop all over again. I like the information and articles given in Quora but this forced usage of the app has got to stop. Or at least make your redirection better.",negative
"Its superb, fulfilling and motivational experience as a Writer, Entrepreneur and Expert. Thanks tonnes #Quora",positive
"The app has a good purpose but there are some issues along with it. When, I search for a topic and all the answers and questions related to it are displayed, everything is good till then. I can click on any question and read the answer, but then the problem arises when I want to get back to the topic page. I have two options, one is the cross mark below the screen and the other is to press my back button. Both these options take me back to the home page. Please provide a back button to topic.",neutral
"Takes forever to open and hard to scroll down when reading long answer, oftentimes freeze",negative
"This app does not work well with my device, but I can no longer fully access my Quora account through my browser. Am not the only one with this problem. There should be options that better allow everyone to use this site.",negative
Forces users to install app to read their content that works perfectly fine in a webpage. If you have a useful app you don't need to force me to log in,neutral
Recently I have found the app troublesome. Answers cannot be written quickly because once I start using the app to write answers the page shuts down.Then it pops out. My phone is fine with all other apps.Only Quora gives me trouble.,negative
UI looks ugly and not up to material design guidelines. Sometimes the app is slow as well.,negative
"I don't want this app, I get the emails and usually read them & follow the links on my laptop. Just, very, occasionally I read them on my phone now quora won't let me read it unless I have the stupid app. I've installed it just so I can moan about it here then I'm uninstalling again. I do not appreciate the attempt to force my hand. I may have installed it at some point if you hadn't tried to force the issue, now you can bog off.",negative
This is the worst application I have ever seen. It has spoiled my mood of reading through Google cromo firstly not able to search contents better then cromo but forcing and redirecting to this pathetic app. Quora is good if searched through Google otherwise it's is worst..,negative
Trust me it's a very useful app. You can find the answers of any kind which are still question marks to you.,positive
Giving one star for the fact that we are forced to download the app to keep reading the content from the browser. :( And I stopped using the app because the link on the browser would not open the same feed on the app.,negative
It was awesome some months ago. But got worse and worse. Harder and harder to get answers and notifications are just spammed. And also polish Quora didn't start yet but become something very different than the idea of Quora itself. As a author of aprox 100 answers i decided to remove 50 from polish version to protest against obstruction taking place there. I dont feel like it is fun place to share knowledge or safe place for my answers anymore.,negative
Worst experience. forced to use it. Couldn't read on Chrome. An unavoidable pop-up appears every single time i read. Holyshit,negative
The topics on the app are very interesting and helpful but the app is slow and unresponsive and very hard to use because it always lags and under performs.,negative
Very very bad app. Its not working in low data network. It waorks in only 4G full speed network and its opening is very slow. It hangs my phone. Improve in this App otherwise delete it from google playstore.,negative
"Terrible experience !!! All of the time asks me to install the app. Your pop up make me really angry, installing the app version should be optional not a fixed pop up. I will never use your platform.",negative
"You guys seriously need to work on the fact that if a person tries to access it from browser, you guys force him to download the app. Some people don't need this app on a daily basis.",negative
I cannot stand websites that make you download their app to view content on mobile especially when their website is fine on mobile.,negative
It's a shame how ad-centric this app has become. About 50% content is either promoted by a company or are just pure advertisements. Shame.,negative
it's absolutely creative and amazing application. it's like gathering all people's experiences and putting them here. ask any question and you will get the fine answer. i totally like it.,positive
I enjoy this app. It hasn't shown any ads and you can get good answers,positive
Whenever i post a question if anyone put there answer error 404 is showing and no data on this page is displayed. What is this?,negative

It gives you attractive knowledge about the world. It's also different from others app. When you are bored then open this app and get relief by knowing the world's past present and future.,positive
"Platform is great....but the android application is not good in user experience....it just feels like "" its better to use browser instead this app""",negative
"Why are you forcing to download the app??? Totally irritated because of these behaviour. I usually read in web version only.while reading the certain topic in the middle it will pop up ""continue read on App"" and I can't do anything during that point.Totally frustratedüò°üò°üò°üò° and now I download the app to give you this review.",negative
Never wanted the Quora App- Just let me scroll a little through the email you send without having a window making it impossible to use Quora without using the app.,negative
"Interesting range of Q&A on an enormous variety of topics = enomonics, ethics, life skills, sexuality, ... and in different languages!",positive
"I really like quora, but it's incredibly obnoxious that they break their totally servicable mobile site in an attempt to force users to download their superfluous mobile app. I protest.",negative
"Good enough ! I get information on any topic & about anything , esp. when it comes from the horse's mouth it shows its relevance .",neutral
"I downloaded this app just to make this review, and plan on deleting it afterwards. Appalling behaviour Quora! I got an interesting email, started browsing, and an ad comes up with 2 options. 1.download the app . 2. I already have the app. There was no close button so I was forced to do something dishonest. I lied and clicked I already had the app. But it takes me to the play store!? Both buttons do! Super misleading! No I don't need a app for every website I sometimes visit! And now never.",negative
"I use chrome to log in to my quora account. Recently i am not able to log in coz its notifying me to download it from play store. Thats irritating,!",negative
"Quora on phone browser interrupting. I don't have space in my phone, so I use Quora in chrome, but their ads keep popping up asking me to download the app. This popup cannot be closed and is making the experience bad for users who use browsers. Please fix this because it is too frustrating.",negative
"This is really ridiculous and cheap a t by quora that it keeps pishing the user to download the app. No, I don't want to download the app and I will read the content online. Rather I will quit Quora anyways its just an entertainment site and not any informational site anymore.",negative
"10/29, I downloaded the update, but it's worse. I can only scroll at a snail's pace. Every swipe sends me back to the top of the page. KEEP TRYING! txs... PS : Is there a way to uninstall the update?? ~.~ 10/6, This app is consistently giving me problems. It- becomes completely bogged down when I'm attempting to ANSWER QUESTIONS. Kinda the whole point of the site, is it not? Puleeeeez fix. Thank you!! Q",negative
"I don't want to install the app, as i am satisfied with the chrome link. Please don't force me to install.. it is so irritating.",negative
"Kudos for the effort. Four stars because it often just doesn't open. Even though I always have a working internet connection, it just sometimes gives a ""no connection"" error.",negative
"Worst app, UI is so un friendly. Everytime they push us to open content in app only. Atleast dont push",negative
"Forcing people to download this app and sign in from a google account is beyond irritating and only speaks to Quora's desperation to be liked. If I'm on the web searching for questions, I want to focus on the subject I'm doing, without being sidetracked, FORCED, into ""continuing reading in the app"". I will uninstall immediately, and also have to unsubscribe from the spam emails you send me every time I sign in/up.",negative
What is the problem of quora. they do not let me use their web version. Is it necessary to download app. I want to use ony web version.,negative
"Highly recommended app for information, fun reading and knowledge sharing. For me its like finding a gem in garbage. Thank you makers.",positive
"I don't want to download your app , I want to read on the website. First force people to log in to read , so you can track all their activity. Now force them to download an app. Seems like this company is doing some shady stuff with your information and shouldn't be trusted.",negative
Rated it 4 stars because the app crashes everytime i open any webpage (through shared post) on it...plzz fix this issue,negative
"I love using quora because i can get a new knowledge and I know what people opinion about some topics. But the cons is... it takes long time to load. And ny phone a little bit 'hang' or freeze when I type. Please fix it, thank you quoraüíï",positive
"Update quora because it uses too much resources of my mobile during answer writing and makes my phone heat and slow, this is not the case with other apps, only occurs during answer writing in quora.",negative
"Forced app download to view Quora per website. I clicked on a question and got an unescapable popup with two options: ""Download the free app"" or ""I already have the app"". The former of course directed to the Play Store to download it. When I lied and chose the latter, it also directed to the Play Store (I suppose I should have guessed). The only way to view the page without having to download an app was to use the browser's ""Request desktop site"" feature. Please reconsider things.",negative
"Chrome on my Android phone (one plus 6t) is not letting me browse on the browser and I'm forced to download the app. If I wanted to download the app, I could on my own. I don't like quora trying to force me to use the app.",negative
"I don't like the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE the app now, ""i Already got the app"" or ""continue reading on the app"" are the only options when going to the site mobile. Pretty dumb.",negative
i dont know why people are ranting about the app. I am using it since it launched and loved every bit of it and the complain regarding the app crash and all never happened with me and I used it on more than 5 devices over the years. one thing I must admit is that it requires very fast internet to function properly. over the wifi it is just great however it behaves glitchy when used with 4g data.,positive
"This is too damn annoying, I click onto another question on the site it tells me to sign in, after thats done it gives me no other option but to download the app instead of letting me see the answer",negative
"This app is horrible. I get the notifications of things I like in my inbox and like the direct link on my browser and it always forces me to use the app, where I lose the article every time. So frustrating. I cant even finish a simple read on my browser. It doesnt even take you to what you are reading if you open in app just to the useless home page.",negative
An idea generator and lifehack dictionary all in one. So many great minds offering solutions to problems and advise. So many highly qualified proffesionals freely giving away job security ...such a great source of inspiration.,positive
I don't want the app! Stop forcing it on the user! I've stopped using quora completely since this bullying started! I couldn't give it 0 stars but that is what it's worth,negative
I'm part of a group and posted. I can't answer my own comments it's weird. It's saying that only contributers can comment. Also I've followed it and been part of it (when it was saying I'm following up to now). Part from that its a good app,neutral
"Its just perfect for every quiery you have Good as of educational view as well as media, gossiping etc",positive
A very good platform for diverse learning and views but disturbed with below level questions /language.,positive
"I had considered giving the app a try before these unavoidable pop ups basically demanding I install the app started ruining my experience of visiting the site through the emails I get daily. I could have excused the interruption of the pop up had it been something I could dismiss but nothing short of exiting the page completely makes it go away, making it impossible to browse Quora anymore in the way I want. So forget it. I've installed it just long enough to leave this review.",negative
It's really pathetic how we're FORCED to download the app even tho it worked perfectly on my browser.,negative
"I don't know why you are doing this but seriously, it's almost impossible to view quora on a browser without getting the download quora app shoved down our throats, there is no other way to continue reading on browser besides downloading, like why?!!",negative
"Great if you reading, horrible for writing. Whenever you move the cursor it lags for min , the UI ends up erroring out. I have never had such a bad time editing my paragraph. This app is just bad and I cant believe anyone who is writing is using the mobile app.",negative
"Incredibly forceful website that won't let you do anything without downloading the app, that takes you way off course. Doesn't even let you copy and paste information",negative
"I would have given this application five stars easily however recently I found myself ""temporarily blocked"" by Quora for not using my real name. Okay. The only thing that I can think of is because there were hyphens in my ""fake"" name. I am so apologetic to everyone that my name is so long! I tried to change my name but apparently I am too fake. Wow. I am simply going to uninstall the application.",negative
"Honestly, sometimes you can get really good advice from professional people whih really helps with school, college work and such.",positive
"Im not comfortable in installing apps but this Quora forcefully made me sign up and had the app installed to read articles which are available in browser too, shame on developers for this move and asking permissions fir contacts, location and messages.",negative
Dont force me to download. I should be able to use via browser if I choose without annoying popups that cant be cancelled,negative
4 starrs because some times when I press readmore the answer flickers and also it sometimes show me the previously opened answer.,neutral
Forced me to download the while I was in the middle of reading a post! Then it opens the post is gone! If I could give it a zero I would!,negative

"Its really helpful and I suggest it to people who are very curious like me, im almost positive they will have a experience as great as mine with this app.",positive
"The app is very slow and work sluggishly. I installed this app because of the annoying and un-closable banner that forced me to download this app. Instead of forcing user to download app, you should make a PWA instead, that would be much faster and better.",negative
"There's no topic following. There's no back option. While i read some topics questions if i want to come back and read other question, it directly goes to home page. What nonsense.... Uninstalled.",negative
"I can no longer access the mobile site on my phone due to an annoying pop-up with no way to exit other than downloading the app. I chose to access Quora via Chrome for a reason and do not appreciate having to close then re-open a browser window over and over every two seconds to get a glimpse of the answer I'd like to view. Until this issue has been resolved, I will no longer be using Quora.",negative

I requested quora admin two times like if any problem in any answer I will change those things. But my account was not overturned and he didn't respond to my mail later on. So don't use this app if you really want to give answers and help others. They allow simply sexual contents not genuine contents. üëéüëéüëéüëé",negative
"I love the diverse opinions, questions and experiences. Great app by all standards!",positive
Changing my review to 1 star from 5 stars which I had giving years ago because I was forced to download this app as the website won't let me read using my phone's browser even after logging in. Such an under handed way of getting more downloads and increasing ad revenue. Didn't expect this when I first joined Quora years ago.,negative
"The app is difficult to navigate, without getting lost. Additionally, when I am compossing an answer, the app freezes, behaves erratically and is sluggish. However, Im installing updates and hoping these things have been addressed. Update did not change a thing. Also, when I returned to log in my account couldnt be found, but i did find a diffetent account. When i tried to delete the different account, it wouldnt let me. Then it deleted my account. My main account, that I live on every spare min",negative
"The app hangs a lot and graphical content takes a lot of time to load. Also, why can't i just browse on the mobile site, why am I prompted to open everything via this app?",negative
"I don't like this one thing... it's too hard to follow the article you're reading because of the layout of the front page format. You HAVE to CLICK the ""READ MORE"" icon 2 times, and sometimes that's extremely aggravation! Other than that, it's great",negative
Very interesting 1st hand stories recounting 1st hand experiences as told by the people involved in the first place. _Told by very unique perspectives.,positive
I originally got on this app by accident. I had been looking for the answer to an esoteric question on Google and was refered here. It does have people that supply really good answers but it also has people who ask really bad questions . This tends to reduce my enjoyment.,negative
Inspie of true name it is telling that my name is wrong. Contact form is advised to contact but where is contact form is not written on android app Pl rearrange menus on android device. The app is good. Very usefull applications are there. It's nice . But though some modification required. After change of my name to fill name it is telling my name is wrong.,neutral
Quora forces consumers to download their app in order to see their website. Have enough apps as it is and it's really annoying. I don't need the Walmart app to shop at Walmart or the Amazon app to shop at Amazon. In the same respect I should have the option to choose to use a browser.,negative
"One of the worst apps I've ever used. There is a delay between typing and text showing and when trying to move cursor. It has a weird ""auto-correct"" which actually changes random letters /merges words when you hit the period or space. It takes at least 5x as long to write something in the app as it does on the web version, but web locks on ""use the app"" window. Am going to stop using Quora altogether because app is so bad, but it won't let me exclusively use web (and I was a really active user).",negative
quora is a wonderful platform to get your questions answered. it would be really nice to see dark mode as there is lot of reading and it will really help.,positive
"I used to enjoy having this app on my Android Kitkat, well yeah I'm not exactly up to date but why the heck do you not support old android versions any more, you used to and it was working just fine, this is so lazy and sad TBH.",negative
I like it but I never had it in my phone and I have in my computer it was good. Only it have little too much bad words.,positive
"I ignored downloading this as long as I could. Receiving the emails was fine, and clicking the links to get the full answers was perfect. UNTIL you decided to FORCE your username into downloading the app by putting a sod off big non-removeable advert smack bang in the middle of the screen. I ignored this and stopped reading for a few weeks, but finally got the app to get rid of the F'ing ad. I dislike being manipulated into downloading an app to continue using your site..",negative
Why should I download the app if I don't wanted to? Most of the time my mobile storage is full so I used to read on browser. But from some few days it didn't let me read. Asks me to download app. This is annoying.,negative
"App constantly refreshes, causing me to lose the answer I was reading or refresh my feed as I'm about to read a new answer. Leaving and coming back to the app while writing an answer will take you to a random place in your writing and edit from there, deleting some text in the process. Is mandatory to use on mobile, even if I feel like the site navigates better. I love Quora. I just bloody hate this app.",negative
Worst thing abouy Quora is it ll not allow you to open in browser. Quora always wants you to download their app and open content in it. There are few circumstances where I ought to open it in browser which I cant do.Quora became a greedy data miner!,negative
Its great that you guys provide a platform for questions and answers but i dont need an app for that.. It is very wrong on your part to force users to download the app for not-so-frequent users.,negative

Loved this app because of its uniqueness. It provides a better platform for those who wants to ask and know about something as well as for those who wants to share and explore the knowledge.,positive
"Been using quora for years now, easily one of my favorite time wasting apps until spaces came about. You are seriously forcing me to join spaces just to access the home page? What a joke.",negative
Love this app I culd spend hours reading. Just wish it wuld automatically open when I'm browsing on Chrome instead of asking everytime.,positive
"Hi, I am getting iritated now using quora, it is forcing me to follow 10 ""spaces"", even though I cannot find 10 spaces that I really want to follow, now my newsfeed is full of article from spaces instead of answers from people that I really like. I am using a samsung phone. Please fix this. I am getting a different result using my iPad. My Quora in my iPad is still working the way I like.",negative
"Being forced to download an app in order to access content is bad enough. But when the app that you've been forced to download is borderline broken, that's freaking infuriating and completely unacceptable.",negative
Why you guys are forcing me to use the app if I can read in browser It's totally dictatorial policies. Same be on you And what is need of having access to full contact access from Google account?,negative
"The loading speed of pages in the app is still extremely slow , please quora improve loading speeds of pages",negative
Absolutely Terrible. Opening links using the app from your phone's internet browser frequently causes the app to send you to completely unrelated content. The app itself is not user friendly at all. It is very messy and hard to use. I would not recommend this app to anyone that I wasn't deliberately trying to waste their time.,negative
Don't know what's the reason but whenever we use search in the app and open the topic and open question s and other stuff whenever we press back button it brings me back directly to my home feed and it's so annoying. What the heck. I need to search the same topic again and again for below answer and even if i press back after opening an answer still it takes me back all the way to my home feed. Plz fix it quora it's been annoying .,negative
Very educational and eye opening app. It has helped me in acquiring very useful and high value knowlege i`m addicted to quora.,positive
"The app doesn't load past the main screen, tried to uninstall and reinstall, still no results",negative
Installed just to tell the devs behind Quora: you can shove your stupid f-in app where the sun don't shine. To everyone else: request desktop mode on your mobile browser to stop it from blocking the page and force-feeding you this useless stinking app.,negative
App gives the options to select the topic you are interested and gives related articles and other topics co related. Good app to have answers to all your questions and concerns.,positive
I extremely love this app. I've suggested many of my friends to use it. Time spent on getting worthless information from social media can be used to gain valuable information from this app. I would like to suggest that you can make a provision for the users to segregate their bookmarks based on different topics so that it becomes easy for future reference.,positive
"It helps me access Quora faster and they were insistent that I download their app. I downloaded it because I was pressured but hey, diamonds are made under pressure. :)",positive
"I liked this app until the last update where i was forced to select a few topics and since then the recommendations are only related to those topics, i understand that they are trying to tailor the experience but it's just not needed for me. Feels horrible. Also the website worked just fine and they need to stop forcing people to download it.",negative
Pathetic update to the app. Its has started forcing me to follow 10 spaces to unlock the homepage. Even if I don't want to. And suggestions are pathetic and are more of propaganda than interest. Also on the homepage the topics previously followed by me have been moved to some place which I can't even find. And after searching the topics after reading an article of the topic it pushes me back to home page to read articles which it had forced me to slct to unlck homepage. So much for FOS. UNINSTAL,negative
Its a very good experience for using this app...it gives knowledge of all fields which is related to us. And also meets with the experienced people of our field .,positive
"Very useful for *quick* answers & solutions. BUT those answering *may* not be as expert as claimed, or as smart as they believe. No certified professional or gov't agency vetts or screens the answers. Thus, ultimately, *every* answer is personal opinion. Best to check official information sources too. Many answers are sensible & useful, but no substitute for professional expert, trained advice and counsel. Caveat emptor--buyer beware. And it's free--so you might get exactly what you pay for.",neutral
"This is for not allowing me to read the full content unless downloaded the App. This is how you loose you readers, after trying to read answer for more than 30 minutes. I'm quitting. It simply forcing me to download the app! I don't want to download your app! Got it? Peace with you.",negative
Low rating because it is forcing me to download the app and not letting me browse quora through chrome which used to save a lot of space in my mobile,negative
"Everything was going fine until I got accused of not using my real name with no way to reply to stand up for myself. I couldn't find a way to delete my profile completely or a way to contact Quora directly and easily. I'm not sure that it logged me out when opted. I will not blame technology for human errors. MAGICALLY while writing this review,I received an email from Quora. If my name wasn't real I wouldn't have received your email. I don't hide my name nor my nicknames. All legal STILL!",negative
"I enjoy quora, but being forced to download the app rather than allowing me to use my own preferred channel seems poorly thought out.",negative
"A very good platform to learn a lot of ideas, trends, and so many relatable issues that happens around the world.",positive
"This is the worst app ever. I would never have even tried downloading it had quora not made it mandatory to read answers put on the website. I understand this is a marketing tool to increase your app downloads, but if you cant develop a user friendly app, its only going to lead to lesser readership. Highly disappointed. Would nevet recommend it to anyone!!!",negative
"Who the hell is handling quora. They force you to go to an app when you are trying to read something on the website, and when you go to the app it doesn't even takes you to the same page you were on website. Have you heard of the word - UX short for User Experience. ü§¶",negative
quora is a great place to learn about different places and different people's experiences is very fascinating and very informative and actually pretty intelligent I love that app it is great I wish I could contribute but I really don't know what to say,positive

"Very interesting, informative and covering a wide variety of subjects.",positive

Great info..and support for victims of narcissists. This app is helping me come to terms with my situation. Nice to know one is not alone in this struggle.,positive
Why! Why! Why! Isn't there an option to move the app to the SD CARD. Its a hogger of my internal memory.,negative
Its educative. You can learn alot with aid of the app. And guess what? The App doesnt missbehave,positive
This app has nice content and also unnecessary content also. I would be pretty nice if they donot upload such content for aspirants,negative
Stupid app. Keeps lagging and hanging all the time. Doesn't let me sign in as well.,negative
Great quality app with high quality content and great answers. Very valuable if you need random questions answered. üëç,positive
Keyboard lags when typing an answer. It doesn't lag on reddit and everything else. Just Quora.,neutral

"Now quora is only for ads, in desktop still able to read but mobile app there is no space to read because of ads",negative
I like it but I don't understand why hitting the back button after reading a question takes me all the way to the starting screen. Don't like using the app bc after searching up for something I lose it immediately,negative
"I used to love quora, but I don't know when, it stopped from showing the topics I liked. Even if I search for them, I can't read any answer of any question because once I read what I want, can't go back and still in that topic. It goes back to home and I have to search again the topic.",negative
"I went to see something and ended up on this website, then it asked me to do signup, that is ok i did sigb up, but then it forced me to download the app. There wasnt ant option to skip that step. That is very bad. Rest things are good and content is good.",negative
"The service does what it does pretty well- in and of itself, Quora as a service has a few downsides, mainly in how it recommends content. I upvoted an answer about someone's journey through methamphetamine addiction, and their eventual journey of recovery- now quora thinks I have a special interest in meth and keeps recommending me questions like ""do I smoke too much meth?"" (A: Almost definitely). The editor is broken. Moving the cursor while editing freezes your phone for > 60 seconds.",neutral
Horrible!!!! I was forced to download this pos app because while using the website it interrupted me every 2 minutes to forcefully tell me to download the app. Only other option is go back which signs you out and you're back to 2 minutes of use until it once again forcefully interrupts you with no other option to close that window than to sign out. I downloaded this app just to post this negative feedback. I don't have unlimited space on my cellphone. I choose to use my browser instead. Goodbye!,negative
Worst app. I prefer using the website. But the message telling me to install app always pops up and doe snot let me browse. Stupid idea. Why do you have a website then. Just kill the site and make it only an application on android or windows.,negative
"Broken on Android, makes phone extremely laggy, does not open answers or opens ones below or above. Shame, really liked scrolling through.",negative
"Creepy, somehow quora has access to my Google search history and messages. It will give me weekly emails of searches related to things I've said or searched without any of my permission. This is modern privacy line crossing in my book",negative
"The experience we get with this app is far superior than web, but please provide dark theme. It hurts while reading in dark.",negative
Why the hell the app is not loading even though i have strong internet connection. The images are not loading and...... Frustating.. Is there any lite version this app..??,negative
It is seriously so so so horribly annoying when you are forced to use this app everytime when u open it in a web browser. I had to download it forcibly just to go through one answer.,negative
"This is a wonderful site for writers to improve their craft. Unfortunately, it is very glitchy. Quora is overwhelmed by the number of people who are part of this forum and it needs to find a way to financially grow to accommodate. It's frustrating to keep being bounced off Quora while writing. Love this site and frustrated at the same time. It would be a 5 without the glitches.",negative
"I like Quora's website. I absolutely hate the app. I hate that it forces me to download it. I hate that I can't just use the better of the two, the website. Honestly it doesn't even deserve 1 star.",negative
Your website keeps redirecting me to the app store but I don't want it and I can't access the website on my phone without it,negative

"Awful app. It continually spammed my email with random emails. After attempting to unsubscribe from unsolicited spam emails, the app demanded I update it before I can stop the spam. Deleting it allowed me to unsubscribe from the spamming. If you do not like your email being filled with spam, so not use this app. not recommended",negative

Disgusting app...i don't understand why i can't browse quora through web browser and forced to download app... To download app first you should make app experience better than wen browser at present its pathetic .. The app is very slow compared to browsers..secondly it doesn't allow you to open different tabs. The experience on web browser is way too good and user friendly... Please allow me to use qoura on web browser,negative
I was forced to download this app because a nag screen didn't have a close button for me to just continue using my mobile browser to browse the site. Predatory tactics to inflate their download numbers. Pathetic.,negative
"Brilliant app and work. But please introduce a dark theme. Extremely necessory. Also facing a little issue. I search a topic, then go to feed, then open a question in that field or space. And after that, when i press back button to go back, the screen goes back to search field instead of previous screen. So everytime i have to search again after visiting one answer.",neutral
"Quora is the living breathing internet-Google. You can think of anything possible to ask and they've always got somebody that can write on the subject. Some people have the whole alphabet at the end of their names, some are self studied, some write from personal experiences. For people that are curious, thirsty for knowledge, want to know whats new in science, tech, medical, politics, movies, comedy, teaching, being parents, yes there's sex too! this is a great app to have.

This app is so frustrating. Keeps on hanging. Unresponsive sometimes. Suddenly throws 504 error. Scrolling gets disabled at times. Why so pathetic app?,negative

Amazing app but they are not accepting partner program thats why i am giving 2 star. If they accepting partner program i gave it 5 stars.,negative
"The app is often slow in loading up pages inspite of having a good internet connection. Also, there does not exist an option to go back to a topic from a question when the topic is searched. The 'X' icon just returns me to the home page and it's annoying to search the topic again and find what I was reading. There should be an option to go back to the topic page once done reading a particular question!",negative
"Access to ocean of knowledge, views, ideas . Enableing people understand the world better.",positive
It is annoying to have to open embedded images of a Quora post in a browser app. It defeats the seamless experience promised by the app platform.,negative
"This app is getting worse with every update. From refreshing itself while in between writing answers, not able to open an answer even after multiple clicks on it to now not able to login. Due to various problems, had to uninstall and reinstall it. But now not able to login. In fact not getting the login page. Just a plain white screen for minutes waiting for login page. Uninstalled.",negative
"The way the company behind this app operates is downright despicable, i dont have enough space in this review to fully cover the scale of how disgusting they are. Dodgy, scammers with no actual information. Im leaving it at this. AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COSTS. SAME GOES FOR THE WEBSITE.",negative
Upto to the last update it was good.....after update its not showing the liked topics in main page .....that is total useless to install ......,negative

Absolutely hate the fact that you have to HAVE TO download the app to view answers on a mobile. Such aggressive marketing techniques!,negative
It's a informative app but it asks to select topics and showes articles related to the selected topics reducing the variety of articles i want to read.,neutral
I don't want to install this app but their web page forced me by not showing some answers on web and redirecting here on playstore. Nonsense.,negative

Trying from last 2 hours to download the app. But it just doesn't get download!!!,negative
Your app is about to piss me off. It keeps freezing the cursor AND the keyboard! And when I exit the entire App it takes a minute for my phone to act normal again thats not good. Now I enjoy writing my answers and sharing but this app is going to make me lose it. I need speed with response time WITHOUT crashing my stuff.....,negative
"This is my first time download quora I usually read on website.

Browsing on the browser version of quora feels much more natural and comfortable. I dont like this app,negative
It really is a good way to learn things. I just think that the app version should let you not have to use your account (Google etc.) to use it.,positive
Why u guys don't allow to browse on mobile on every click I am getting this popup to install app. This is really frustrating.,negative
"Downloaded the app purely to complain about the fact that on the website, a popup will ask you if you want to download the app. Both options , yes and no, lead to the play store to download it. There's literally no way to get rid of the popup, and it is annoying. And I'm equally that I have to sign in to be able to see more than like, one or two articles.",negative
Only reason I'm downloading it's because you're FORCING ME TO. Absolutely no other way to read content on the website without downloading the app. So freaking annoying.,negative
"Dear Quora, I installed the app just to write my review about you. Please do not force users into downloading your app. While 8 try to access the comments on some topics, there is a rectangular box (I don't know what they call it) that shades the screen and I can no longer read the comments in that page even though I have signed in to it (I'm talking about mobile browsing on Android). I'll be happy to give you more details about my problems and account details if you really care about user expe",negative
"Very nice app, it actually suggests what I want to read, I hate when I have to leave the app because it's so addicting! I recommend it, it has answers for literally anything",positive
"Forces you to download the app to read any answer in detail, if you are using an android phone's chrome browser. No way can you bypass it (not straightforward at least)",negative
I prefer the website. Why would I need an app just for a Q & A? They even force us to install the app to read more answer. I only go through the web once in a while to get some perspectives and that does not happen everyday.,neutral
Like the questions and conversations but the the app itself sucks when navigating. Always lose the conversation I'm reading if I accidentally tap to another page. Going back takes me to my home page and I have to search for the conversation. Probably just me but not intuitive and frustrating to navigate.,negative
"The features are great, but i am more into the content which has been very helpful on my quest for knowlwdge and wisdom.",positive
"Why we need to install the app..? Just browsing would be fine, for some queries, but it always asks us to install it. This is really pathetic.",negative
Worst app of 2019.... No pages loading. My internet speed is 50 mbps. Also you can't access pages from browser either as it will redirect to this nonsense impotent app. What a disgrace!,negative
"Seriously what exactly is the point in updating the app every other day, when app crashes and server error remains a perennial issue",negative
Although it is great to find all the answers to ur curious mind just at fingertips but they made me download the app for the same reason coz i was using quora on web browser which i find suitable despite being on app.The page didnt made me view the answers as a result of which now i have to download and use this sucker app.üöØüöØ,negative
No need to read boring newspapers and articles on the internet. You get into a niche space on the internet where you can read about any topic - and it won't be boring. Welcome to Quora!,positive
It was good app but now taking time to loading and most of time image is not loaded and display as blank.,negative
"I love reading on Quora site, but not in the App, I'm just installing this Cr*p App because we are getting forced to install this. Now We can't read on Quora site, we has to install this app. Very CHEAP MOVE FROM QUORA. üëé",negative
bad page loading problem. worst app I ever use so far. Digest are good but app need to fix.,negative
"Quora is all good but the app isn't. It's a pain to use it. The UI is weird and too white and empty. Also, you can't go back to a Topic, hitting the cross or going back takes me back to the homepage. Needs a total redesign.",negative
I'm sure your app is very good. Or at least you think so because you force the web browser users to download the app to continue using your services. This is highly annoying and the fact that you have to force users to download your app already says something. Please do not make people do things against their will. I'll end this politely because I've seen some similar reviews on the matter who couldn't hold back. I urge you to reevaluate your decision to practically coerce your users.,negative
Excellent app for sharing of knowledge. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is that the phone becomes sluggish after I load the app. I've a LG V20. But overall excellent app,positive
Sometimes questions are unanswered and sometimes its difficult to find an answer to your own query. Rest is all fine.,neutral
"So, in order to read another article, on the mobile website you're forced to download the app. If you say ""I already have this app"", which you would think is also an alternative way of saying ""I do not want this app"", it still takes you to the app store. No way to get rid of the big box obliterating the screen unless you go in desktop mode. The app is not necessary at all, as in desktop mode, the article can be accessed just fine. Thanks, Quora.",negative
I was in hurry to read an answer from my mobile browser but your browser forced me to download mobile application rather than let me read the content. It is really disgusting when you are daily user and you use quora from your laptop and when you need it in hurry and open it in mobile browser it start giving such instructions,negative
Want to use it in chrome because of the dark mode but it isn't letting me to. Had to download this app which has no dark mode. Want to use it at night but the white just kills the experience,negative
"Don't force me to install the app! I installed it only so i could write a review. I'm reading an article on the browser and halfway thru a pop up prompts me to install the app, and i can't read any further. No thank you, I will read quora on my PC when I am free. I'm uninstalling this as soon as I finish typing.",negative
"It is far better than all the social media app viz fb,instagram,tik tok.if you really want to get real world knowledge then use it..",positive

Very interesting nd useful stories. Openly written and true stories. Wonderful experience.,positive

"I really love this app, but it kinda slow, buggy, and crashy in my android phone.",negative
"Searched something on Google and clicked a Quora link. Day or two later I got an email from Quora about suggested topics. I don't even remember making a Quora account. I guess it got my email from being signed in on Google Chrome. Tried to sign in with Google to check if I even had an account, and was forced to download the app. Saw no activity on the account, so I guess it just created a new one. Deleted the new account. Will not use Quora again.",neutral
"I don't understand quora's moral standpoint and guidelines. On one hand, articles which are factually incorrect and offensive are allowed to be published. But when such articles are retorted with factual comments, it gets brought down.",negative
Search engine of quora is waste of time. Instead of searching for my question it is searching everything thing else and high lighting strings in those questions. It's better to search your question on Google.,negative
"If u suggest an answer in Opera Mini, it will be more helpful and fun if u stop popping up ADs. Its too annoying pls üò£üò£",negative
"One star. The popup to install the app obliterates any commentary and when accessed through the website. It's ridiculous. There's no way to delete it. I used to have a lot of followers, now I don't even bother with quora. Plus, my account went missing so what's the point. All those followers gone. The way the site is run, and all the glitches, make Quora impossible to enjoy.",negative
This app is a semi web wrapper. I saw error message similar to what we see on webview. Unbelievable !!,negative

I wanted to read something neat then a window popped up saying to see the app I couldn't exit out and lost what I was reading.,negative
"If I could rate this app a zero I would. I was forced to download the app because the website kept prompting me to download the app and wouldn't give me the option to continue on the website. Honestly this is unacceptable, let people decide whether or not they want your app. Some of us prefer to use the web page. Very disappointed.",negative
"You lost it when you force people to use the app . You want to forcefully grow your users base , too low from you guys. This is height of desperation. Learn from other big Tech companies like Google and Facebook, never force anyone to download apps. Moreso, your app is malware infested as flagged by my anti!alware,",negative
This app is amazing but it would be better if you improve the UI a bit and probably add a dark mode option.,positive

One star for making it mandatory to download this random app just to see one thing on the actual website. Unbelievable.,negative
I actually had to download the app in order to read an article that I had already found in my browser. Very unconvenient.,negative
"After sign-in from a mobile browser, the Quora site gives only 2 choices: ""Download the free app"" or ""I already have the app"" both prompt you to the app store download, which prevents the signed-in user from viewing the content. Then why require sign-in??? I don't want another app, so I can either: wait and view from a PC, or I can write a 1 star review and seek answers elsewhere.",negative
It's not accepting name in profile. Telling wrong name. I nspite of correction it's advising request form but where is the form it's not written.,negative
the app is good but not satisfying because most of the time home page shows lots of protocol error. I'm unable ask questions due to errors,negative

I haven't started using the app yet but I'm giving it 2 stars as I was 'forced' to download the app as Quora did not allow me to use the website version after a few minutes in. The advert for downloading the app wouldn't go away and there was no option to close the ad. I don't like being force to download apps and this really affected my original good impression of Quora.,negative
"Nobody Likes to be forced into doing things they don't want to do. So, why are you guys making me download your app? I'm signed in on quora, reading my random stuff. Why lock me access and bring me here. Did you consider if someone really want to use an app for a search? No!! Why would I care about using app when we have Google search engine and it works best. To be honest I dont even use google app/toolbar for search , because browser has extra features. I have screenshot of your popups.",negative
"This app and website forces you to download the app just to read articles that IVE ALREADY SUBSCRIBED TO. Not only is that fact alone extremely annoying and show just how much the developers care about their users, I have noticed that quora is flooded with bot-generated user content and/or questions. I think the original intent of the devolopers has been lost due to greed and the current platform is flooded with repetitive questions and irrelevant questions that seem to be generated by bots",negative

This app is not working in my phone. My phone is redmi y2. Please help me in fixing the problem,negative
The answers I got & the group of people I found on this app may very well have saved my life. The support of so many people from all walks of lives who experienced the same things i did pulled me out of a very dark place in my life. No idea how i even found this app but i thank God for Quora,positive
Stop shoving your app down our throats! I wouldve still used it had it been useful but it clearly isn't. I hate that the website keeps sending app popups without a cross to dismiss it.,negative
"Please stop forcing me to download this useless app whenever I browse Quora from my phone! The website works absolutely fine and there is no need to force people to waste phone space and memory downloading this useless, redundant app!",negative
"11/11/2019 EDIT: QUORA STOP FORCING ME TO USE YOUR APP! It does NOT work well and I prefer the browser! I give one star only because the website kept prompting me to download the app, it is annoying. Please stop it. Edit 10/08/19 I update it today because Quora, after forcing me to download their app, they are now forcing me to use it!",negative
Lately the app isn't working well with any keyboard(android). It's a mess. You can't type anything. I am in a creative writing mood and this typing problem spoils everything.,negative
"Good website, horrible app. I cannot type an answer without the keyboard bugging and messing up my sentences, the app is also horribly optimised and is very slow at doing simple tasks. Needs an overhaul in my opinion.",negative
"Absolute garbage, doesn't let you use the web version just because of this. I hope this app had a body and fell from 5 kilometers up.",negative
I use this app and sometimes I open it from goggle chrome and it always advertise about app that's tottaly disgusting if people wants to use app then of course they will install it you don't have to always advertise in browsers and disgust people in this way so I uninstalled your app due to inappropriate advertisement in chrome,negative
"I love it, I can speak, I can listen, I can talk, I can hear voices. For me, it's the most trusted and reliable social experience till now.",positive
"One of the worst app I have seen, it keeps crashing. Also if you go on quota website it keeps telling you to go to app, why then you have a website. I would give zero stars ... Sorry negative stars if it was possible",negative
"It forces me to install the app from web. Here is the correct rating for you, please pass it to marketing department, thanks.",neutral
"How to go back from a answer which is in a topic page....when i press back it goes to the normal feed instead of the topic page...when i come back to the topic page again, all answers are shuffled ...this is kinda disturb....i gave 1 star coz u would notice it !!!!!",negative
"Would use to use it a lot, but unfortunately noticed one thing that the reason for which quora is made for is no more in existence Literally an educational ans has 43 upvotes in 2+ yrs and an ans on question like what was your last text to your ex has more than 5k upvotes in just 2 days Literally plz developers see to it... Tysm hoping for the reply",negative
"I'm really agitated that the back button feature on the mobile app has been changed to pull you back to the main page instead of whatever page was the last you were on. For example, I'll search something and read an answer and hit back, but instead of bringing me back to my search it brings me back to the main page. I used to use quora every day but this frustrates me deeply and I hardly use it at all anymore as I seem to always lose an interesting answer by being pulled back to the main page.",negative
"I don't understand why the hell I am FORCED to download this application?!?!?! I DO NOT WANT IT!!! WHY CAN'T I JUST DO THE QUORA THING IN MY BROWSER????!!!!????!!!! To force people to use an app, when we don't want to, is just wrong! I prefer to use a browser, as opposed to a specific app!",negative
Forced to download it by not allowing using the browser. And the app not working just showing a try again button and some cryptic message. Highly dissappointed.,negative
"Very descriptive,knowledgable,insightful application to keep you engaged in reading.",positive
"Forced me to download....too much...... But,the content in it is really helpful...contetwise it's 5*****",positive
"I had A great experience with this app!. You can connect to the world, you can read many interesting facts, sometimes news, and explore more topic..! I love using this aap!!",positive
I installed the app just to give them a 1-star review because that's what they deserve for forcing readers to download the app. Not even an option to decline. Totally dick move and you lost a subscriber. Also I would start telling people to stay away from Quora. I like reading online on the browser. I don't need another bloat just to read what I like. Stay away from this app people. It will just fill your phone with ads and promotions. Too much for reading. Stop supporting their website.,negative
"Ad infested nightmare, used to show several answers at once but now hides all but one, has a lot of ads which are nearly indistinguishable from actual posts until you click them.",negative
"Too many ads, loads previous question after clicking on a new question, too slow.",negative
I have the app downloaded in my device but I would like to browse quora on my browser itself after finding a Google result to a quora link for seamless experience. Sadly it will force you to use the app no matter what you do and will block you from opening a link to other answers on your browser.,neutral
"Blocked from using your website on a mobile browser, forced to download this app to use it. Ridiculous decision, not everyone wants more apps, esp for fully functioning websites.",negative
Giving 1 star coz I was forced to install the app and was not allowed to use web version. These loosers feel that phones have unlimited memory to have such worthless apps.,negative
"I love website but the app is forced on you and then uses whatever language your VPN is on. Couldn't fix it. Very frustrating. If I don't want to use the app, please please please just let me browse in my phone browser, don't let stop me continuing til I have the app.i use it seldom enough to only need browser viewing and not waste space with another bulky application",negative
This review is not about the app performance. I am giving it 1 star cause I was forced to download this app when I tried to view it in chrome.,negative
"Most of the personal experiences appear to be fake and at times written in very poor english. In my second chance, I still maintain the same opinion about the write-ups. Very few personal experiences appear to be true.",negative
"I am using Quora on my mobile using Chrome. I will have to say, the application is quite redundant. Sometimes it doesn't load images, the transition animation is not fluid. I will suggest you work to make app more efficient. It's funny how the webviews render perfectly while application has glitches loading images",negative
"I have a problem if i open a question then after reading it if i press back button then i returns to home page. Why is this happening if i want to go at back page ,quora is leaving me at their home page ?",negative
Forced each and every time i tried to read something. I do not understand why i cannot use browser to read my ans. Hope they fix it someday and give freedom to their users.,negative
Awful. Quora website stops mobile users from using the website by putting a crappy banner up that you cannot exit. They try to force you to use another pointless app. Or maybe just stop using tge quora website?,negative
I like to know the different opinions of people on various subjects and learn first hand from their experiences. Many are highly educated and experienced in life.,positive
Excellent for enhancing your knowledge and polishing concepts! Really helpful for students!,positive
I used to enjoy this app but recently I can only view the app in portrait mode. I use a tablet so this app has become worthless to me. I refuse to hold my tablet (with its landscape case) in the portrait direction.,negative
"Its a great app, has a variety of answers for multiple topics albeit a good combination of intelligence and humor. Only problem that i have is the time that it takes the app to load, even when using fast wifi.",positive
Great app.... Just love reading on this app. It's a very resourceful and helpful app especially for students as well as for adults.,positive
"Quora as a platform is better than as an app . Writing in this app is the worst experience i have ever had in my entire life , it made my phone to hang and also that cursor stalls a lot than my life. I usually enjoy writing in Quora through PC so I thought it would be easier to do so in my phone , but I have never been proven so wrong . So for whoever wants to download this app , do it at your own risk because this app corrupts phone. I suggest anyone to use the website than this app .",negative
I love reading about almost everything. Specially people's views. It lets me. So yeah I like this platform. And it contributes a lot to the society as it helps people to open up and debate on several issues which makes people aware of the different topics and diverse cultures out there.,positive
1 star because you're forcing me to use the app. Why do you even have a mobile site if all you're going to do is show an undismissable popup to install the app?,negative
Its a good app for answering our question.It helps to get different views from different people and also its a good learning app.,positive
"Its really slow and lag; it is taking too much time to load, also iam not able post the quiestions easily. Please allow us to read in browser without installing your app.",negative
"Many function buttons not working like continue, reply, comment... I think it's fault of latest update",negative
"I really enjoyed the articles puzzles quizzes and so on, as I'm disabled and not able to get around like I once did, apps like this are a life saver literally, I pick up and put down when I choose. Again great app and thank you. Kevin Hinchcliffe.",positive
"cant change the language! i currently stay in germany but i dont speak any german. the app layout and all the question/answers are all in german, even though my language is set to english. i cant fix this stupid problem. please help me fix it.",negative
"Amazing.Various topics, various openions & various experiences,the combination, projects towards lot of new knowledges & ideas to the readers.",positive
It will edify you.. So good ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è I request you to please add a night mode feature too. It will really help people who are active at night.,positive
Back button feature is completely disgusting. Previously it was very nice but the recent update has made it nonsense. If I press back button it comes back to the main page.,negative
"Not a time waster application, helps in enhancing a topic thoroughly and clearly.",positive
"It's a really good and helpful platform. But it forced me to install the app as I couldn't read some answers in the website. Please let us decide how to use this service, it's not like i end up asking something everyday to install your app, so let us view are required answers in your website.",neutral
"It has an extremely annoying problem where when I tap on a notification of a reply or upvote. It launches the app, goes to the relevant reply for about one second then jumps up to the original post. Then I have to scroll down to try and find the reply. The app was just updated and it still does that, same as the previous version. The app didn't do this when I first installed it, so you've broken something recently. Fix it. The *extremely* annoying part of this app is that the Quora website somehow detects when it's being accessed from a mobile device, even when browser settings are set to identify as a desktop browser. Then the site absolutely will not allow itself to be accessed. It *goes against the desire of the user* and launched the Google Play Store app to download the Quora app. That's the kind of thing *malware* does. Stop trying to force mobile users to install your app when they want to use your website.",negative
Very informative and lovely spaces. Interaction between many learned scholars is good too.,positive
"Seems to be more intelligent people, rather than type first, think later that you find in most social apps.",neutral
It lacks a night mode. Its whitish background hurts my eyes at night.,negative
They have this policy that you have to use your real name. So I typed it out exactly as it is on my ID and was flagged for using a fake name. I went through the trouble of getting my account reactivated only to have it deactivated because I was using a fake name. That being said both times I was flagged it was right after someone didn't like my answer to a question.,negative
The notifications are too slow. Plus there should be an active notification system like some tone etc,negative
"For me the App was an inferior experience. I now use the site in Chrome browser. Unfortunately Quora is constantly fixing things that weren't broken, so at this moment I don't get any confirmation that my answer has successfully uploaded. Despite that, I will not be going back to the App.",negative
"It's okay but there are some issues for about one year or so: Laggy keyboard and format to edit whether it's answer/comment post/draft. I wish there were some search box within my bookmarks , following/follower, and such as list, as for now I keep sending some of marked answer links I like thru another third party message whose search box within chat is possible. Such a hassle.",negative
"Using Quora is frequently the high point of my day. There's help to find answers to baffling questions, stories to lift spirits, community and interaction helping alleviate all that""loneliness"" the news is constantly saying we all grapple with. Love it!",positive
This is an amazing app to find answers for your questions really I am using this since a month and it helped me a lot I use this app every night before sleep for about 15 - 20 minutes to find answers of my questions sometimes I dont have any questions than I ask for some interesting story of my interest and many other entertaining things Such an interesting application thank you for bringing this,positive
App is ok but it lags a lot. Hope that developers include night reading mode in upcoming version. They need to restructure the app with a refreshed user interface.,negative
"Quora forced me to get this app! On the website, after being logged in for a few minutes -a pop up demaning you get the Quora app will prevent you from continuing to use Quora; conveniently the popup has been designed to stubbornly prevent you from exiting it until you comply. In 2019 there are more websites than ever before, I am now going to join one of Quora's many competitors and become their loyal user instead üòÅ The app has now been deleted.",negative
"This app is slow and not user friendly, now I hate being forced to use it for my phone cause on the web that dialog box asking me if I have the app won't disappear",negative
"Quora Top Writer 2018 here. When a company coerces its patrons to download an app, as Quora is doing right now with its intrusive and un-closeable pop-up on mobile browsers, you can be sure the app itself is an unmitigated hive of pernicious ads (and possibly other, more sinister exploitation). I like reading Quora and writing for Quora, but I definitely do not trust the app and will not use it as long as Quora corporate attempts to railroad me into using it.",negative
"This app requires Sign in, draws data from your device. I dont think this app should have access to storage, call log and most off all Microphone? Why would the app require access to microphone?",negative
Very informative helped to decide on what the legal status of recreational use of marijuana maybe in other countries. And how to obtain visas and safe havens for tourist thank you so very much for thus search engine.,positive
"A Google search led me here. I was subsequently forced to not only sign up for an account but also choose other topics (10!) of which I really had no interest AND download an app to read the answer to 1 question. I was annoyed with the sign up (but I get it), however, requiring the other things before I can get what I came here for feels like a violation. I get you want me to stay around and peruse your offerings as I understand it's most likely how you get paid. Demanding I do most assuredly",negative
"Very good concept. Quora is the sum total of all opinions & thoughts of our world. The application also is good, with a clean, clutter free interface. Highly recommended.",positive
"Everytime I open any answer which contain images, the images gets trimmed from up and down. Serious issue fix it soon!",negative
This app is no longer available in landscape mode on my Samsung tablet. Please correct this.,negative
Garbage. When you request to see less of a topic it continues to bombard you with them and when you delete a comment it still remains then you continue to he bombarded with responses. Do yourself a favor do not use this app,negative
"Hi Quora. Wanted to confirm whether this unusual activity of the app is a bug or a built -in function. So if i search for a particular topic and i check a particular question from the list it shows the full answer. But when i press the back button, it should lead me to the topic page right. But it doesn't. For some reason, it takes me to the main page, i.e: home page. This tends to be irritating after a long time. I have to keep going to the search option and check for the topic againüôÑ!!!!!!!!",negative
"Maybe I'm wrong and am just bad at using the app, but there doesn't seem to be a dark mode option, and you cant copy and paste unless you press suggest edit. The layout seems especially bad, I wish there was a way to see the most answered and popular posts of the last week, month, and year in each space. Its surprisingly bad still, after all the months I've had it. given the website's popularity and the amount of people who have downloaded the app you'd think it could have been improved by now.",negative
The new version is really bad and has a lot bugs. It is unusable and slow. It glitches out when I open my notifications and sometimes the answers won't plain open.,negative
Thank you for this amazing app! I really needed help with a lot of situations and so many answers are there from other people's experience! Anyone who is struggling with real life situations download this app! You won't regret it. Great idea!,positive
"This is the main reason why i hate operamini web browser, you think you are downloading something on a website but then you will found out it was operamini app that you've downloaded.. Their developers aren't wise enough same as you quora developers, , not everyone wants the app, the fact that you force me to sign up and even download your app is pathetic, i install it just to write my review and I'm uninstalling it even if I Iiked the content i was reading. Google has to say something about dis",negative
Love Quota so much! I'm learning so much. I love how this app gets you involved in things. I have never felt like I was qualified enough to give anyone answers to questions on FB like I do on Quora. This app somehow knows immediately how to match you up with the right people and the right questions. It's nothing like I've ever experienced before. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,positive

"Like most people here, I downloaded the app after being strong armed into it by your utterly distasteful, page blocking adverts. The app is horrible. Your website works much better. But then, you wont let us use the website would you?",negative
Good. But if we open video it took us youtube. It should be modify as picture in picture like whattsapp. There is no download option is major drawback. Please correct my suggesion based on my suggession,negative
"It's fine, lovely, sweet, and nice. Any more and it wouldn't be able to cut the tomatoes, and then where would be?",positive
It's a good app but there is this one thing that bugs me a lot. When I search and open a question and go back I go to the home page rather than the search results Fix this pls,negative
Worst Fcuking App ! At Starting It Was Ok..But Now everything when you open quora on Web Then It Asks Permission To Open this app automatically...These App Had oNly One Thing that is Lag..it only lags everything,negative
Superb app for knowledge and for solving queries but does not open full document in web browsers.,positive
"First of all... Need to approve on feedback opinion i spend straight 5min so i can tell you what's on mind to improve... 2nd thing i like to touch is to i like that features of chrome to hold on to certain words and quickly Google search about it, and this is the reason I mostly suffer quora on the chrome not on given app... So now you know what you need to improve your app..",neutral
"The app is extremely annoying in the way it handles writing answers. The text cursor freezes, letters are repeated on entry, especially when trying to format words with italic or bold text, making text entry frustrating at best and a useless exercise at worst. In general it seems that the app's answer-writing module either bleeds RAM memory or consumes too much stack or has erroneous multithreading. This needs to be improved by a significant amount.",negative
I love the different people that come on I like the questions I love the interaction with different people sometimes make it be very demonstrative but I like the fact that allows you to exchange ideas allows you to express yourself clearly and when you're out here in the world it's hard to see things from people's point of view until you listen to them and this Avenue allows you to consider everybody's point of view . Thank you guys for inviting us Avenue for communication.,positive
Forcing me to download app again and again when I m reading article on mobile Web page. Get yourself to a doctor please!!,negative

"Best learning app in all aspects ,gives a platform to interact with people",positive
"Avoid this app. It is slowly destroying my life. It is one of the most addictive things I have ever done. I can't sleep, TV no longer interests me. My wife is wondering where I've gone. Every one who attempts to engage with me is referred to Quora. My kids are told to post their questions to Quora and I will respond there. I expect to save money on entertainment now.",negative
It's really nice to use it and interacting with a lot of people of same intellectual level and reading answers of highly intelligent people from all over the world.,positive
"The concept and website are good but the mobile app is horrendous. How much un-user friendly an app can get, quora shows you. I'm convinced that their designers and product managers don't have common sense.",negative
"I don't like the new update. The banners and the bottom navigation bars are taking up alot of screen space. Now, there's a scrollable marquee as well for Your Space Might as well include an advertisement banner. Update: typing answers can be unresponsive or lags really bad. I gave up after a few minutes.",negative
I love quora but after this new update. The home screen won't load only. No new questions appears. Please fix this issue,negative
"Every time when i read an answer, i press back option. But it gets directly to homepage instead of viewing the recent back page.",neutral

A must have and best app for the smartphones.. Just one request - please bring the dark mode for the app.. My sincere request.,positive

"Stop trying to force this app, I don't need you to try to force me to download the app everytime I try to read something on quora on my phone. It's not acceptable and I'm pretty sure it's against Google's play terms of service for app developers. STOP IT.",negative

Please fix a bug... When you search about any topic. you get many search result about that.. After reading any one result when you press back it take you back at search bar..,negative
"Writing answers lags horribly, reading is just fine, but writing or editing long content is horribly slow. Worse is the fact that quora forces you to use this poor quality limited edition web browser insted of whatever you like. So poor app, plain bad policy, poor experience overall",negative
I don't want to use your god dammed app... It's so buggy and yet you force people to compulsorily use it... Don't slap it on people's face. This is one of reason I had to leave this app.,negative
The new feature of spaces has ruined everything. The topics appear no more at the bottom... That too almost nobody is liking this new feature....please make topics appear again,negative
"Well no problems with the platform, app needs a quick fix. When I search for topics and expand any answer boom there is no way to go back to the results. Either I search again or close the app. Please check",negative
"Edit: No fix yet! What is the reason behind the frequent changes to the UI? It's ridiculous to have the common UI behaviors changed all of a sudden because the app updated. The latest one? Unable to go back to a searched topic page from a question. Now both the X button and the android back button close the topic completely and takes back to the homepage instead of just closing the questuon. Which means if you want to read another question, you have to search for the topic again. Very annoying!",negative
"The best app, but takes too much time to respond on 2G network,please solve this problem!",negative
i love this app. I can't believe I just recently discovered it. it's an amazing concept executed perfectly.,positive

"Browsing in web browser are not allowed. Forcefully its redirecting to open app, which I really hate.",negative

"Great content, I've used quora on the computer for years. However, this app is flawed. Glitchy typing (that sometimes makes zero sense as to what its doing [and I know its not my phone because that's the only app that I've ever had trouble like that]), and it will randomly freeze and close itself out. Like it goes to my homescreen, which is clearly unprepared for such a random hard stop of the app, and takes a second to load all of my apps onto the screen. Again, I love the content! But fix this",negative
"Quite enjoyable, I think the UI needs some work on the mobile.",positive
"It's really annoying and not user friendly to require downloading the app not even allowing to close the huge popup, when you just want to read a two line answer on website.

I went down two stars JUST because of that. Thanks!",negative
"Until recently it wasn't too bad. I use my phone in landscape mode with two thumbs. I find portrait mode extremely difficult. Quora used to work in landscape but just recently this stopped. Now I'm more or less forced to get up and go to my computer to answer questions, comment or message people. I actually prefer the freedom and versatility of the Quora app, but I can no longer use it since landscape seems now to have been disabled.",negative

A far better way to be engrossed on social media than Facebook or YouTube. It has greatly contributed to making me cognizant about realities of life and overcome my acute anxiety and depression.,positive
I went to this app once before and going to it again reminded me why I dropped it. It builds up the hype after the question but after around 20 next page you lose interest. The site is all about advertising not information. One star rating if that.,negative

"Quora started making me download the app just to follow the questions I receive via email, so I finally give in and do it, but now when I click on the link to answer the question, it opens the app in an entirely different place and I lose the question forever completely eliminating the point and still not revealing the answer I was looking for. Very disappointed and very done with even the emails now, thanks for wasting my time, but no more.",negative
"This app is very often going unresponsive without reason, load each content very slowly, despite i have a good internet connection, and sometimes make my lg G7 device become so slow and unresponsive. I like quora, read it everyday. I'm not going to give 1 star in app if you give the user choice to keep use the web version. What the hell the quora team thinking when they not allowing user use web version in mobile. When the app is bad, at least give the user choice to keep use the web version",negative
"I find a lot of honest answers by a lot of well qualified persons. Used with discrimination , it is a great educational app.",positive
"I got blocked because quora thought its not my real name.but it is my real name.and I am not able to submit appeal to verify my name.when iam going to mention this issue on contact form ,it keeps showing try againüòê.so i am not able to submit proof for my name",negative
Hopefully my one star vote will join the voice of people who are objecting to being forced into a download they don't want. A very bad impression of a company that is supposed to be about free knowledge exchange. I will be asking the question why does quora force an install of the app......,negative
"Have to dig through so many crappy questions and answers to find quality content. Mods do not respect the answerers. That said, some excellent content is also there",negative
"5 stars for content, 3 stars for app experience. Strange that till today quora developers are unable to put together a night mode in an app which completely relies on reading.",negative
"After the last update this app crashes, behaves weirdly and when I click on answers to read nothing happens! Just the Read More button is underlined. This is very frustrating.",negative
"To open to new way of thinking... Honestly, you won't find answer as deep as in ResearchGate, but came from much wider perspective, broaden my horizon. UPDATE The developer apparently remove landscape view and double view mode, 2 stars down for each. (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)",positive
"This app is filled with knowledge, curiosity and interest. A user can ask a question or read other questions answered by other users. Its very easy to use and all one person has to do is choose their interests and there one will open doors of knowledge they didnt know existed.",positive
"I'm finding this app really frustrating. Even after the latest update, the ""read more""-links don't work. It shows that I've pressed the link but nothing happens. Can't read anything beyond two lines. So annoying.",negative
"Just wanted to view one answer and the website started forcing me to download the app. I don't have enough storage to download the app but I sure can give a rating. 1/5, why do you even have a website if you're gonna force people into downloading the app.",negative
On website First they ask you to log in with facebook or google. If you choose one of them later on they do force you to download the app. You can't continue without. And then they ask you to log in with the app once again. Never ever had so much difficulties to reach a web blog on my entire life before.. I would even give you 0 üåü for doing that,negative
Every day I get some valuable information and also entertainment. Some of the answers and posts are extremely interesting and well researched. It's an addiction now.,positive
I am tired. And cold. No feeling in feet. Left worse than right. And legs are shaking. It means cold cold. Like so cold/frozen it burns. And I am so hungry. And lonely. And want to be loved and carried. Picked up holding.,negative
"App is good! But the app needs dark mode. The eyes pop out by using white theme, do something.",positive
"Down voting for the experience on app on slower networks. The questions load, but the app doesn't allow you to open the answer!! Fascinating",negative
"Interesting information with lots of opinions ( some qualified, some not). Some facts, but mostly personal experiences.",positive
This one star is for FORCING me to download the app. And of course I'm deleting the app right away after this feedback.,negative
I personally believe if you are at a position in life or even a beginnerüî∞ then it's just best for you.. You can follow the people's from various profession and can get advice from them.. And a lot more.. Things to say.. May be this box isn't enough.,positive
Uninstalling. You can't browse more than a couple of pages in browser. It forces you login. And when I login it forces you to view it in the app. And the App shows you more ads than relevant information. Gone are the days when I used to enjoy Quora.,negative
What kind of arrogance is it that you don't even publish what changes you are bringing with the update? The app navigation is something I've not getting used to even after 3 yrs of use. The app keeps repeating same questions with different answers every single day in notifications. It's getting very boring now. There are so many groups I have registered but I keep getting most of the notifications on animals only. Many times The bookmarks are not registered nor the likes.... Losing interest fast,negative
"some recommendations--- 1. No option to download pictures ‚òπÔ∏è which is the biggest drawback of this app and pics load very late. 2. Update should be there to make is fast load. 3. While typing everything become extremely slow which is disappointing. 4. There should be option to start reading quora from same place, from where we left but it refresh Everytime we open it. And we lost some important things. Developer team please fix them.",negative
"CAN YOU PLS PUT BACK THE POP-UP VIEW & SPLIT VIEW? My review was 5* until they changed the app to not be able to open up in POP-UP VIEW or SPLIT VIEW. It used to allow me to get notifications in pop-up view & open the app in pop-up/split view too. It is a feature in Samsung phones - Android 9.0-10.0. All apps are capable of doing all 3 of those, except a very small few.",neutral
"I'm deleting this app. They got too many rules. I've been blocked because I'm using the first three letters of my nameüôÑ. You can't even delete previous answers or questions? Quora, you are not making this fun. I would rather just internet search all the questions I have. Having too many rules makes it look like yall want to have a lot of control over us and that you want to know our exact information. I selected a lot of topics but I only get notifications on the topics that I viewed lastüôÑü§∑üèø",negative
I'm forced to download the app instead of just staying within the browser. üò£ Fix it and I'll keep the app and give 5.,negative
I have not seen this type of disgusting app before it is tooo slow and if the app is slow the quora team should make that people use the web option but then also for reading full article it will say you to sign in and then download the app very annoying. ...,negative
"This is an amazing app for an amazing social media platform. However, I'll be more suppprtive if Quora application develop the dark mode. Thank you.",positive
"I'm a Quora addict. Really useful stuff on history, culture, administration, law etc. One thing I really appreciate about Quora is that, it improves itself as the time passes.",positive
"Mostly interesting and thoroughly engaging. I enjoy the resource love giving advice, and getting great ideas from real people.",positive
One of best quality of plateform you get the best of experience which you can relate with real life. Many the new things to learn from here and you can follow the topic you have interest. Great job done.,positive
A very knowledgeable app. But I think getting a free space of writing about anything without any question will be more good!,positive
The app is shockingly slow. Using the browser is so much better and faster...,negative
First when I went to their website it said to enter my email then I can read but after that it forced me to download the app to read. This was so frustrating if I could give it 0 stars I would,negative
"The forced way of using quora app Quora doesn't have a simple feature known as ""night mode"", so i started using kiwi browser for reading quora as it has a dedicated night mode which is different than invert colors cause photos and image looks bad on invert option, so in order to create problems instead of providing solutions, quora decided to block website view of thier app.I am uncomfortable using the desktop mode as well as app as white light strains my eyes a lot quora dev team live in shthol",negative
"Writing hacks just barfing out random thoughts, regardless of factual or historical inaccuracies. Don't refer to their inaccuracies either or your posts will be deleted and you'll become an enemy of the Quora State.",negative
It is the slowest popular app i have ever used Whenever i click on an answer it takes a long time open Sometimes you need to keep tapping again and again for that I am having such experience since a long time and you are not fixing this,negative
"People ask interesting questions. I enjoy helping people. But I have to admit that I'm a little bit of a cheater, because I often Google their question. ü§∑",positive
"The app itself is alright. It's easy to use if a little slow. However, I would have never downloaded it if I weren't constantly being harassed to install it when reading an answer on mobile. When trying to scroll more than half a page down to read an answer, an UNDISMISSABLE POPUP appears and tells you you can keep reading with the Quora app. There are 2 buttons on the pop up, both of which will take you to the app store if you don't already have the app. Ridiculous.",negative
Very Frustrating. They have good things to read but will only let you read for so long before they make you download the app or lose what you are reading.,negative
"I am not well versed in any language so far as expression is concerned.( I know three more languages viz.Hindi, Marathi Kannada.)",negative
Best app for answer all question which will come in your mind . Easy to add question and answer privatly as anonymous . You can also earn as a helping member of quora .,positive
This app is very useful but the performance is not very great ..does not provide a very smooth experience..it works very slowly.,negative
It's a perfect site. Where personal experience are shared. we get a lot of information by which we can make sure of not repeating the mistake others have done.,positive
Quora is a very good apk. Which we have the ability to answer any type of question and such apk should be in good wake. You can also download it.,positive
"I highly dislike being forced to download another app when the mobile page is clearly there. I need a few opinions on questions. But nope, look at me taking more time to write a negative review.",negative
Too many notifications. Need to be able to toggle one switch for be rid of all notifications. Uninstalled!,negative
It is amongst on of the best website for sharing knowledge.The user interface also so simple and user friendly.,positive
"I like this better than the site, if only because when you navigate back on the site, it ALWAYS goes to the top of the page and it drives me nuts. On the app you go back to the place you were. I don't know how to get rid of the notification alert (the tiny red 1) though, but that's a small price to pay for correct navigation.",neutral
A great place to learn more about people's thoughts. Would be nice if the app has a dark mode for better reading experience.,positive
"The app is fine, but I didn't want it. I wanted just to lay in bed and browse. However, every few minutes, I got the download the app pop up. I guess it worked because I downloaded to keep reading, however, I will uninstall after I finish reading for the night.",negative
Useless app. Never opens any link from Chrome. Been using for months and still haven't successfully opened a single page. And now they've made it mandatory to install the app. Idiots. First fix your app. Then make it mandatory,negative
"Not able to edit credentials and always app popup ""No internet"" message. Annoying instance.....update the app for smoother experience till then one star is enough.",negative
"I hate this app as it's useless, I got a mail for an interesting article found on qoura, so I click and it opens the article, now as I'm reading, this gets cut short by a notification that states, ""get the digest wherever you go"" then gives two options, first option is to download the app and second one is to state I already have the app, now my thinking is if I have the app then it will open the article, nope, drags me to the main menu where the article is not shown that I was reading this...",negative
"I encountered that the website forced me to use the app, which is not very welcoming and seems awfully desperate. What if the app is unusable due to bugs? What if I use the website due to poor UI/UX in the app? What if my phone doesn't support it? Plus after logging in, it navigates me away from the question I wanted to look at prior to logging in. There is even an xkcd comic to describe this",negative
"I enjoy reading and answering questions on Quora. My hope is that someone will read an answer of mine and learn something that will be invaluable in their life and it will make a big difference in their life for the better. I learn a lot, and I enjoy the Quora experience.",positive
Great app to expand your knowledge with writers from childrens to adults and even more experienced people.,positive
The app is forcefully imposed while I'm quite happy with the browser version.The browser version is more easy to the eyes.,positive
Unresponsive.. freezes every time it is opened... uninstalling,negative
"Why can't I just use the browser what's wrong wit reading on browsers this is so annoying when I don't wanna download it but it force you to or else you can't use it. If possible please remove the ""There is more in the app"" ""Unlock the Quora experience"" pop ups",negative
"App is SO God damn annoying to use!!!! Links me to random stuff I don't click on and NOT what I'm trying to read!!! I liked Quora but stopped using it because of that, and the fact that browsing in chrome makes you download the app. What a way to kill a site ..",negative
Works fine for first few minutes after startup. However freezes forever when used for more than 20-25 minutes. This is really annoying bug.,negative
Dear Quora. Let me read the articles on the web page on my phone until I'm really hooked up then remind me to download the App. NO NEED TO PREVENT ME FROM INTERACTING WITH THE PAGE TO FORCE ME TO DOWNLOAD YOUR APP. I WILL DOWNLOAD IT WHEN I WANT TO. NOT IF YOU FORCE ME TO DO IT. Thank you. I only gave this app 5 stars so you could read my review.,neutral
"Older versions were good. Quora keeps asking to download a newer update all the time. Unfortunately newer version doesn't not add anything new or fast as such. Problem is ' new updated version' takes too much time to open up. Leave videos but images also don't get opened easily. Somehow if opens it consumes lot much of time. Even ' Read more' doesn't open up . Other apps like ' Facebook', 'You Tube ' opens instantly .",negative
"I had a good impression of Quora, but i feel annoyed with the latest updates and policy. Stop forcing to use the app. When i want to access content, i am asked to login. When i login, i am a asked to use the app. Directly say you need to use app to use the content. Why one should Waste time to login? If that's your policy, you should revoke acess from Pc also. I am able to use the Quora web browser in PC.",negative
Everyday I get thousands of quetion request and I tried to give answer one thing i observed that was despited me everytime suppose you have little knowledge about specific topic you can increase it at zenith. This app specific Features is frequently app updared or latest version Heachtic services reluctant my time. As a knowledge gaining and time pass app just go and install.,negative
I'm currently using poco phone f1 and whenever I write an answer on Quora taking long time (10mins or more) my phone launcher which is poco launcher stops working or hangs so much that i have to restart my mobile. Bugs like these discourage people to use quora. Hope the developer team of quora will resolve bugs like these.,negative
"I don't het the point of installing an app when I can get work done using a browser , Please stop that annoying pop up asking me to install the app when I using quora on my mobile browser",negative
Lovely app. Very educational and provides insight on both everyday life issues.,positive
"Wouldn't even use it if the website didn't keep bugging me about it. Clunky features, annoying bugs, slow loading, and random crashes makes it feel of poor quality.",negative
If I wanted to download the app I would. It doesn't make sense to even have the website if you show one result but force us to downloading the app.,negative
"Struggles to connect with the internet although other apps do not have such a problem. Also in the browser when I click on Quora link, there is a message ""switch to app"" but has no ""not now"" option. I do not want to switch to app because of connectivity and delay issues. Please fix.",negative
"I have found this to be an interesting app given it's an app for getting the best answer possible to some things u might question ur whole life. I get on the app once a day atleast, some people ask the craziest things.",positive
Constantly forcing someone to download the app when you are reading a story is probably the worse way to encourage me to download it,negative
"Knowledge based app. Quora website and app serve as a knowledge plus informative. People get to share their experience. Now, the task is on developers to keep it authentic. It's a good platform.",positive
"Amazing app, I've asked a question and in minutes received the very satisfying answers for that. I'm happy for being a part of it.",positive
"i have learned much thanks to Quora..the app so far has worked quite well. I just found a minor bug. The settings for the App do not offer a way of having more than one Quora window to be open. Not even sure if that is a bug or not, but it sure would be helpful once in a while to run the app in two windows.",positive
"I really love it. I use it for my speeches, essays , etc.. A great hand in students life",positive
"Update #2: 1 star because of the security breach. Hundreds of thousands of people had their bank account information stolen. Many people had their funds exhausted. Update #1: 2 star because Quora has no scruples when it comes to censoring conservatives. First comment: 3 stars because Quora is great, but the app has too many ads and has many glitches. Also, the keyboard has numerous issues which renders answering and replying impossible.",negative
The app is very helpful. But the interior is not user friendly. It's very much complicated too. So many options and links and buttons make it difficult for users to understand and concentrate onto the content answers or questions. So I'm eagerly requesting the team to make the interface little bit clear and simple.,negative
"I can't translate using Google translator in app version, whereas in direct Google search it was possible.",negative
This app sends too many e-mails. Had to unsubscribe from the email service multiple times.,negative
"Excellent platform. BUT RECENTLY IT HAS LOST ITS PURPOSE. MANY PEOPLE ARE PUTTING CONTENT LIKE DATING AND ELSE, EARLIER IT WAS A PLACE FOR INTELLECTUALS NOT ANYMORE KINDLY LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE",negative
Quora is a highly knowledgeable and fantastic website. Wish there was a night mode and a feature for offline viewing in the app. Cons: 1. Forced to install app after browsing for some time (Huge turn off),positive
the text is not showing in the app after update. please fix asap. critical!!!,negative
"This app is not up to modern day standards. It would be right at home as a beta app, because it's full of bugs. Answers take time to open; sometimes you can keep tapping on the answer 10 times and it won't open. Other times, you click on an answer and the app opens another answer. One cannot expect a third rate app for such a fantastic website. FIX YOUR BUGS.",negative
I did not had space in mob to download this app But shamelessly quro opens only on this app And keeps showing massage on browser to install app and stops everything. I always appreciated quro but now I am fade up this mean money minded people.,negative
"No dark mode? FORCED to install? ZERO star app. I was perfectly happy browsing, answering, reading through Quora in my phone's built in browser. I've been doing it for years! Was able to use my native browser's dark mode to save batteries, save my eyes, and also be less bothersome to those around me when reading at night. Increasingly, Quora has now been INSISTING that I install/use their app in order to read answers. I can't close the popups, and it BLOCKS the answers. I do not approve!!!",neutral
"I love the website, but this app needs work. Every time it's installed it drains my battery and makes my phone much warmer than it is normally, as well as making everything on my phone run painfully slow. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result always. If I open the app, it almost makes my phone burn my fingers from the touch. Samsung Galaxy S9 with all the current updates.",negative
"Giving answers should be more important than asking questions, other than that, it's a good site. The app is laggy and glitchy compared to the browser version of Quora, it's a shame you are pressured to use the app version on mobile.",negative
"I enjoy reading politics threads on Quora, because most of the contents are objective, neutral, and filled with facts from all sides, in contrast to certain western media reports. The app is clean and easy to use.",positive
"Great , informative and touching many spheres of life in order to quench the thirst for knowledge . Participation of people around in simple and convenient language is a pleasant experience",positive
App itself is good. Forcing to install it from web view really inappropriate.,neutral
"The questions and answers are genuine. I mean anything could be asked and someone answers tge question. Its like gathering ideas, getting to know about something or someone. I literally enjoy the app. It's also fun.",positive
"""Always something interesting where you can definitely learn a boatload, it has a very broad spectrum & its a mine of useful information about whatever you can imagine really""",positive
When you go out and go back in the app it starts from the main page again. Its not what the user usually wants because you lose the information you were reading.,negative
It is at times very difficult or impossible to get to the place to write answer to the question because of some technical fault in the app. This is very annoying.,negative
Don't know why the website is forcing users to use the app. Since very long ago they have stopped supporting many options like sharing the link in WhatsApp. It should be at the will of the users to use whatever medium they prefers. This is bad. Stop doing it!,negative
Such an useful app which tells so much interesting things and gets the chance to intrract and read some beautiful minds...thanku so much for this app,positive
"Website forced me to the app, which is awful. Let us use whatever medium we want, or just remove your website and go only with the app.",negative

Unable to access that content from chrome as well for which I downloaded app,because all the time it redirectes to app and end up showing as can't connect to the internet, try again!!!!!!! Hence, uninstalled the app.",negative
"Imagine making an app SO TERRIBLE that it ruins your website! I downloaded this abomination just to leave a review, which you clearly don't care about bc everyone else here says the same thing. Website was excellent, so why the push to use the app? Gtfoh, you disgust me. Deleting.",negative
"Downloaded the app only because of interference from a 'download this app now' to continue reading, low and behold, article has disappeared. And what's worse, can only view in vertical phone position with NO OPTION to view in the normal horizontal position I was previously using. App deleted. Wikipedia will get more use from now on. :(",negative
The app has a lot of bugs and is really irritating to use. I would rather just go to the quora site on the internet than download this terrible app.,negative
Your site is amazing but I can't access it without it forcing me to download the app so one star for you. Shame. I prefer web over app because it have more freedom.,positive
Stop asking me to constantly download the app. I use the mobile Chrome version because it works better. The app barely loads any answers.,negative
One important thing that Quora needs to learn is behaviour analysis because once if i am ignoring some types of questions or users regularly then those should not turn up again. But it's happening repeatedly. otherwise this is the best platform for great interaction.,neutral
Good platform to ask anything that comes to your mind. Though some answers may be biased. But its natural.,positive

Very informative questions and answers. Very happy with the Application.,positive
"The app is good but the owners are mad. They ban your account for nonsensical reasons. My account got banned coz a friend logged in to his account from my phone. They accused me of having multiple accounts. I contacted the company via email but they responded very rudely. I then told them to delete my account permanently. App is great but I am never returning to it. So many answers written, so many followers earned, all ended in a splash. Will launch a similar app to destroy Quora. Promise !!",negative
You suck quora. I would've given 5 star but no they want 1 star üëè. Seriously they will not allow you to read answers on Google Chrome no matter what ! You have to open quora app every time you wanna read something. And btw the app isn't the fastest app in any way. Heads off to thier public service. Very frustrated :(,negative
"Very informative and knowledgeble platform for both young , old , students,proffessionals and homemakers .....its like an encyclopedia of knowledge ....",positive
Forced me to download app when i just wanted to view a question. While the world is moving towards responsive online apps you decide to go backwards by creating native apps. I wish you had spent these resources on improving your existing web.,negative
"Good app. Helps you to get answers from a lot of people. I'll have given it a 5 star but because sometimes the questions are not answered immediately. And in addition when I ask a question, I don't see the question again so even when someone answers it is wouldn't know",positive
I searched for an answer on Google and it lead me to Quora. The website then forced to download your app which doesn't open at all. Don't force download an app if it doesn't work.,negative
Nice app with very good and personable questions. Most of these answers are pretty dead on accurate as far as peraonally 1st hand experinced answers. Id recommend anybody in aearch of an answer to any qurstion to post it on this app and they will get the answer they are looming for more than likely.,positive
Crashes. When I reopened it wanted me to give a rating instead of taking me back to the article I was reading.,negative

"Today was my first real day to ck out this app & I am thoroughly enjoying it. I'm loving the Q & A""s, they're in ref to diff topics, very informative plus I have discovered I can relate to a majority of them. I was even able to get 1 (out of many) of my own Q's asked that I really need advice on what I can do for my Chorkie dog who suffers from bad case of Separation Anxiety when I have to leave him home. Also, doesn't matter if only gone 5 mins or 5 hrs, he ALWAYS acts as t it's been 5 days!",positive
Of late I am experiencing the app non responsive. Nothing appears on screen after opening for long and also the pictures doesn't get loaded in many answers,negative

Heyyy person who works at Quora and is forced to read reviewer comments!!! I'm giving one star because I feel forced to download this app. I tried reading through a thread on the website and a window kept popping up telling me to download the app and wouldn't close. So one star for your cheap tricks.,negative
"I really love Quora. You can know so many interesting things and can also interact with different people with different perspectives from all over the world. Although, there is one thing that bothers me about this app. The white interface of the app can be quite straining for the eyes sometimes. So, I would really appreciate a dark mode for this app. God bless all those people who created such an amazing platform for sharing knowledge.",positive
This app is full of necessary of contents. But i have a question to developers why they make website and app both when they didn't give us to access the website sometimes and told us to download app.,negative
"It's very frustrating and user-unfriendly, at least in the mobile app. They don't show the date a question was asked or the asker's name with the question. It's very hard to navigate and find your way through the site. The site absolutely doesn't respond to questions from users. They change the option menus, removing options. Most recently, there's no ""Pass on this question"" button.",negative
"Edit: Why am I being forced to download the app? I don't want more apps. Just a great place to read about topics that interest you, and the answers are from a personal point if view, so, they can be fascinating as well as covering most, if not all, of the points of an argument.",positive

There are many great things about quora. The biggest problem I currently see is the quora partner program. It's making some of my favorite writers (the people who do the work) leave. All because quora wants to support the question spammers.. which is annoying seeing 20 different identical questions.,negative

I like this app because of educational prospects just keep getting caught up in other subjects of interest.,positive
"I got learned numerous astounding things on quora app. Literally, It is the quintessential app to enrich our knowledge and lives to the best.",positive
The developer forces you to install the app to finish reading answers online. This is so they can data-mine your phone. I installed the app only to leave this review. I wish I could leave 0 stars as that is what an app that is forced on me is worth.,negative
"Quora is so good on browser I can open many tabs use it in dark mode but the app is useless, no tabs no dark mode n if I am reading some answers but got interrupted by calls then the page refreshes n I miss what I was reading earlier and quora forcing me to download quora app is worst thing . Stop asking me to download it's app . I am comfortable with browser only",negative
I never do reviews at all but I can say definitely I like this app because me being a super nerd when it comes to anime and comics I enjoy answering questions all about that.,positive
"I love it, being able to connect with various minds around our planet, whether it be for advice, knowledge, a suggeston or opinion, or a simple answer to guide a decision. Great stuff..",positive
"Until a few weeks ago this was a great app. My main problem is when replying to a question or comment, after typing the first few lines, the keyboard freezes, won't recognize inputs, moody about clicking an earlier word to edit. Freezes, locks up, blocks keys, erases wrong letters. This is the only app I have problems typing in, and it doesn't matter what keyboard I use. Plenty of memory, very few processes running, cleared phone memory, closed all open apps, uninstalled/reinstalled. Buggy app.",negative
"This app is fine, most things work fine and I've recently discovered that I actually have a psychological talent that could help numerous people. But my problem is one, my quora seems to be different from other people's, it doesn't have ‚Äúpartners‚Äù option. I wanna earn some pennies in here too, Hello quora Support, don't you think I deserve that?",positive
I don't appreciate the app being forced on you if you try to use the mobile site. Seems desperate and rude.,negative
"Too much allowance for nonsense questions that people can simply Google. Also, not very easy to navigate and can get confusing at times, like when you go back to an answer to look for a comment and other issues. They really should streamline the app a lot more.",negative
"Best online gift delivery website ever! I gave this title because I am really impressed with their delivery services. Last week, I placed an order for the combo of Strawberry flavored cake and a bouquet of roses for my girlfriend. That combo was not only looking beautiful on their website, but it was totally stunning when it was delivered. It was my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday, and I really want to make it special. And this combo did it best to make the day extra special for my love.",positive
"Very good, get to meet people with different personalities and see idealistic questions and realistic answers. You know what, I Love it!!!",positive
"I love quora but I just read an article on my browser and saw something else that seemed interesting but after selecting it the page loaded and the article was there but right over it was a popup you could not possibly dismiss to read the article beneath it. At the time I had bad service and it was impractical to install, especially over such a trivial piece of information. Please add a dismiss feature it's not necessary to pressure people like that.",negative
Bad app and bad experience. The force you to use this app instead of the website by limiting access to the website for mobile devices and this app does not allow you to access all of the website. But worse is that Quora bow down to pressure from the Chinese Government and their Wu Mao army and give in to complaints by them about any perceived negative content about the Chinese Communist Party or negative content about China's actions in the South East Asian or Pacific regions.,negative
Please add dark mode. Lots of phones use AMOLED displays now. It would be a tremendous advantage to us. We can save battery and read longer.,positive
"Unlock full experience at quora, this damn message was blocking me from viewing the answers online and finally fed up of this reckless insanity, i downloaded the app. Now, I see the questions, but I am unable to read the answers, i have a fast Internet connection, but message pops up saying 'connection aborted'.I am utterly disappointed.",negative
"Nice app, its optimized very good and also it has many other options.. But main things has to minimize is many functions in it, because of many unwanted features its being complex,,",positive
"hope night mode option gets added in an update. really useful when reading at places with low light. don't know what's going on with quora admin, but earlier 5 min spent on quora were enough of good info but now all i can see is questions regarding screenshots which deserve 10M likes and stuff. u guys need to clean up this site!",negative
Very bad ..why one need to install an application to read out from Google ... Time is not meant to be wasted. .,negative
They've started this cheap trick which uses the contributors and their skill for the benefit of advertisers. They're using our content for their benefit.,negative
"Quora is great but the app itself has some issues with functionality. Like, sometimes when you want to open an answer, it takes some time to load it, doesn't responds or displays blank space. Fortunately, its not a breaking bug but still, as a critique, I've to include these issues i faced.",negative
"Quora was once a highly respected platform with users who truly desired to answer questions that they were knowledgeable of. However, Quora has steadily declined throughout the years and I don't find it as resourceful because users are now more concerned with making money from posting ridiculous questions and answers. The constant forceful push to download their app is irritating. Quora blocks you from viewing content until you download their app even if you are a member. Two thumbs down.",negative
Generally a good forum. Ideally would have more precise filters to eliminate unwanted topics.,positive
"I love this app but I am having a problem when I am writing a message it shows error in uploading image please help,",negative
"Latest update doesn't support screen rotation, Quora should fix this basic think as fast as possible also they should include HISTORY CLEAN option.",negative

"User experience is too bad, needs major improvements in UX. Freezes too many times(not because of the phone,mine is 6/128)",negative
The app sometimes shows that there are no stories for you. If any solution could be done please help,negative
Just installed it to give this rating. Quora doesn't let users to decide what platform they want to use and force us to download the app. It's truly annoying that mobile website doesn't even give an option. Uninstalling this and never going to use Quora again and switching to other alternatives like Reddit which also have a mobile app but doesn't force users to download it. (And I might download it too),negative
"Great for the most part, but misses out on a five star rating because photos don't open in the answer screen. :/",negative

Worst app ever do not reccomend download also terrible design and just an overall disgusting layout and colors. Too bad it had so much potential.",negative
It seems like you could spend many hours on here but not much income could be generated. There is a vast amount of people and generalities on here. My responses get moved around quite a bit.,negative
Why quora why???? Why the heck your app crashes each time whenever I unlock my phone. I am heck tired of it. My phone is redmi note 5 pro with miui 11.,negative
"if some of your company's ui design can learn from zhihu, a similar app in China, then it will be better to use!!!!",positive
"I used to be able to open a thread in my email and read it. Now when I open a thread it always pops up covering the screen recommending the app, with no way to close the pop up. Basically if you want the privilege of reading anything in the email we send you every day, you have to install our app. So I installed it, leaving a review now, uninstalling and unsubscribing. I used quora occasionally to pass time, not enough that I want an app dedicated to it and shouldn't be forced to install it.",negative
App very very very useful and now i am gaining knowledge. You can also call it the Facebook of Student who are preparing for any exam but its questions searching algorithm is too bad. Really need to imrove its searching algorithm.,positive

"Quora, whats up? Its not like you guys dont have money... your app crashes, freezes, does weird things like typing anything it wants to... what the heck? It's weirding up on me... like I'm typing a text, next thing I know half of my text is in between the previous paragraph... or not typing at all... Then I have to wait for like 2 minutes until your app processes the things I did 2 minute ago, then starts sloooowly close and reopen things. No its not my phone.

"Overall a good, useful and informative app. but got blocked me from editing or adding any further comments.for not using my real name in my profile. Really?!? Screw Quora. I uninstalled it. What BS!",negative
"Potentially great however ruined by being very user unfriendly no dark mode in settings and glitchy in that comments etc take too long to load in total agreenent with another comment VERY hard to navigate it's good in browser but they won't let you use it on mobile devices yr redirected to the app, unimpressed",negative
"Why dont u let us read the content as it was..Why its compulsory to download that app which is just the worst app. I dnt get full images, its always half. Evrytime i have to open every image to see it..May I know why?",negative
"I really like Quora, so I'm rating this high. It's much less enjoyable than on a computer, though, because it's harder to avoid ads.",positive
"I am FORCED to install this app. The site in the browser keeps blocking my view, telling me to install the app when im trying to browse. I do not like this and i will not change my rating because of this underhanded method",negative
I love using quora to find answers from everyday life problems to complicated ones about finances and just topics I am not familiar with. I also like answering requests when I get them wish I had more then 1 follower lol. Thanks quora you make the internet a better place.,positive
It would get a better rating if the screen rotation still worked. For the last few months it has been locked in portrait mode on my tablet which I mainly use in Landscape mode. Vey frustrating!,negative

I have learnt many things from quora not just about education but about how the world works. This app got me ready to face the world outside and helped me find my way in life. Quora is not just an app but a tutor in all aspects.,positive

The Quota site has an annoying popup that can't be closed and forces users on Android to download the app. Please remove this feature. You will lose far more traffic on site than gaining users in app by this manner. At least I'll opt out!,negative
Great place for sharing experiences and for gaining knowledge about a plethora of subjects.,positive
"*Not Worth It* I installed it just so I can post a review because it is terrible how much Quora harasses you to get the app as you are trying to read. This heavy handed maneuvering is ridiculous. For this reason alone, I will NEVER use the app nor recommend it to anyone. Proceeding to un-install immediately.",negative
I am on the browser for continue ask me to continue with Facebook or google. I continue with Facebook and then it blocks me to delete this app?? No i would not use this app. I just downloaded to rate 1 until you learn to behave. And now i will uninstall again this app. Are you Happy now???,negative
"The app has too many bugs. When I search for a topic, open a page and an answer and tap the back button, I get redirected to my search page and not the topic page. Moreover, it compulsorily forces to me to add translation in Hindi and then I can't find the original question that I asked in English.",negative
This is truly global apps. If you have some doubts in any subjects find the answers here. If you found none just forward your questions and in short time people expert in that particular field would answer you.,neutral
"I think this is the most popular ask and answer site/app. The only thing I dislike is it doesn't have categories, instead questions just appear in your feed based on algorithm of some sort. When you ask a question, it doesn't appear anywhere except in the feed of people's whose answer you've requested. Just gives a perception of the site being a mess and not organised.",negative
U have to make feature like night mode...that will help us to read out all the articles..I think u think about that...,neutral
It is not keeping my bookmarks of some topics intact which can be kept on the bottom of the screen..as it keeps on disappearing and appearing randomly,negative
This app does nothing more than create a platform fir journalists and writers to steal ideas from others. It is a huge waste of time.,negative
A very informative good app... That solves many daily lives and common problems of all ages by experiences of different people of different nature around the world... :),positive
"It was most irritating app cause notification. When I thought I turn off it came back again and again, with deep level of possiblity to get some. Even most underrated apps which is purpose to do that do not gain this level. It is useful but level of spam...omg.",negative

"This used to be great site until all the changes. Now I can't browse the website without a pop up (that won't go away, regardless of what I do) asking me to download the app. Tactics like this will not get me to download your resource hogging app. I used to be a very active user of this site, not anymore.",negative
I only downloaded this to write a review but if the website tells me to download the app WITHOUT ALLOWING ME TO EXIT OUT OF IT one more time I will break my own phone.,negative

First time installed it and after asking to continue with google or facebook i choose one and then app stopped working very bad experience need lots of improvement,negative
I used to love it. But they are now forcing to use app. Can't be viewed in mobile browsers. I can't have such a highly addictive app in my phone. I am deprived of my sleep.,negative
I love this app lots of great stories to read and tell others about you own experiences ***the only down fall I've noticed is when your typing your response the keyboard disapears and you have to wait on and off for the keyboard to return and only be able to type one word at a time when that happens I just exit out of the app completely because it frustrates me that'll make me stop using the app for the day. Oh yeah not to mention the grammar Police are serious when it comes to correct grammar!,positive
"Don't like being forced to download an app, I want to browse on my phone, not be hijacked by a pop up to download this, especially as it won't go away.",negative
"Bullied into downloading this app on. Was just reading a very good article online then the Quora logo with the message that says if you want to continue reading this article you must download the app"" download button underneath. There was no way other than that download button to navigate outta there.",negative
"Never knew developers could be so greedy that they are forcing every user to download it's app. I can't read an article on my browser because everytime an add pop-ups saying I need to install the app. I love reading articles on Quora but not enough to have an app permanently installed on my phone. So here I am, leaving my review behind. Now uninstalling and unsubscribing. You are going to lose many potential users because of your greedy strategy.",negative

"I hate the app, it irritates me because it does not open the same story that i have from email notification. Instead it opens something else. As result i use the Chrome browser but quora forces you to use the app if you continue to read on the browser. Please fix this problem.",negative
Less media.............more to focus on what you want to read An overall good experience just need some polishing.,positive
Took some getting used to but so far I have no complaints other than it being a bit difficult to learn the layout initially,neutral
"This is a good app, & pretty informative. It's pretty easy to navigate on/around it too- & do stuff. Thanks & please take care.",positive
Quora is my best friend and personal adviser. I read lot of information before taking big decision. It is always correct. It's hindi version is also very good.,positive
"Stop popping up ""Do you speak _____"" and platform language changes automatically. Don't change the language automatically it sucks For few moments I was so confused then I closed the whole browser and re-entered the link. Please don't do this type of typical options.

There is vast information available but there are lot of doubts about its accuracy and authenticity!,negative
"Very easy to use! I really love how this app is designed! 1. It's very easy to use and understand. 2. You can bookmark answers you like so you can find them easily again. 3.

Truely genuine side keep it up quora team.,positive
"Recent updates made the app pretty slow and non-responsive regardless of network and hardware, be it mobile data or Wi-Fi. Basically, answers take their sweet time to display after clicking on them, and the feed updates very slowly when scrolling. This being on a stable, low latency Wi-Fi connection, on Android 10. The app also seems to mess with CPU usage, forcing high frequencies, which drain the battery much faster than it used to, all the more baffling since the app slows down after this.",negative
"Ahhh!! Never ever make account on this app, it will never let you delete the account and keep sending you emails even after changing email preferences...",negative
I gave it back its 5 stars. It has improved all the bugs. Now running perfectly on my phone.,positive

Annoying editing. I am trying to ask a specific question (stated it is for UK law) as otherwise I get answers that are from the US. Therefore not answering my question. I keep editing my qu back but the moderation keeps changing it!! It's getting very frustrating as this is causing me to not get the correct answers I need as law is different. Please sort this out and stop it as it's putting me off posting more questions. Edit: I have deleted my account after the 10th time this happened.,negative
"Very good to find some great stuff, only when you have a good intention for good content. But everything is educative and productive...",positive

"You must improve the writing experience for low/mid end phones, I have a Galaxy J7 Prime which is pretty decent. For example, if I write a long answer and I move the cursor selection then the app starts to terrible freezing.",positive
Stop telling me to use the app. I've said no over and over. The reminders also glitch up the website. The first 50 noes are enough.,negative
My knowledge of many aspects of life has grown tremendously since I've downloaded this app. I first heard of Quora while listening to one of Dr Jordan Petersen's talks and I've been on it since. The content of the app really changes and challenges one's perspective towards life in general.,positive
"Good app, my only grouse is it keeps prompting me to edit my details, like every single time I submit an answer, how annoying is that. Aside from that it's fine.",negative
"Though it is a good app for asking and answering questions,it does not provide to add picture of the problems.Rather, it allows only links.So, if that is fixed then it will become more convenient.",neutral

MY REVIEW FOR STUDENTS . these day it is growing more educational way which is quite helpful. for students i strongly suggest this app. few spaces which i like programming computer science university advice ......etc but i also warn u it is also a place for high distraction's like about relationships topics about 'weird things in life '.....etc. SO USE IT CAREFULLY . *VERY GOOD APP.,positive
"Downloaded this app just so I could give it a 1 star review for their website being garbage and advertising the app, blocking you from being able to continue reading anything beyond first answers. Trash.",negative
"Horrible, not only have i had to deal with the constant emails, which it wont let me remove from the ""subscriber"" list, it wont let me use the website with out the app. Not using the app nor the website anymore. Removing people's freedom to choose, removes people's interest in it altogether.",negative
"When I click to more option, it opens slowly and open different article. It‚Äôs so frustrating for quora. Improve more option clicking system. Fix it.",negative
"I loved this app. One request is to add ""sort by and filter by"" options (As most of the online shopping sites uses it) to easily view answers rather than scrolling down the entire page. Please make an update..!",positive
"Amazing app that allows you to interact as if in a social media, share what you have to say and improve your writing ability!",positive
"Stupid mobile website won't let me read the content in browser, it forces (!) you to download and install their app! Unsubscribing...",negative
"Good for asking weird questions and getting lot of real answers.!! no need of money,no ads prblm. most questions and answers are available .üíô",positive
So laggy and still have many bugs just like the old days (2017). I even didn't know what has changed.,negative
"The app may be fine, if you want it, but I installed this to complain about not being able to use the site due to it blocking content and forcing me to the app. Pinterest (who also does this) and Quora will now be sites (and apps) I avoid. Be aware, most people who have a problem with your policy will just avoid you and not make a comment about it.",negative
Not rating the app but their website that constantly wants to force you to download the app! And that app sucks! I guess I am done with Quora since using my browser on it is not allowed anymore with their forced popup to dl their crappy app!,negative
Downloaded this app one year ago. It was my favourite app but now it has lost its prestige. It gets crashes every now and then. I am even not able to write answers on it. Some answers which i click to read doesn't open and throws me back to the home page. Really very disappointed with this new update.,negative
Can you make it night modeüíû cuz it is too bright in the dark with a White light even i was lowing the brightness tq,neutral
"Too slow. Have to click on link twice to open it up, bugs me everytime when I want to read something",negative
"Text size adjustment not available. And text is way too small to be read comfortably. Also, app lags too much. Even website is better than it.",negative
"I love this app. I love sharing my experiences with cats with others who ask questions about them. I also enjoy reading other people's answers. Some I agree with some I don't but that's to be expected. I've just spent the last 2.5 hours answering questions and commenting on others. My arm is tired from typing so I have to stop (and I really should go to bed, it's midnight) but I look forward to the next time, the questions are always interesting and there's lots of them!",positive
"Good app, enable us to uncrease our knowledge. But it does not work offline which is a major drawback. We live in bharat {backward india} not in india{ digital india}. Does bharatiya have no right to be knowledgeable.",negative
It is an amazing app for gaining knowledge and doing something productive during your free time,positive
"One of the best app... Gain knowledge by asking questions and reading answers. Before this app, I use to play games in my mobile, now I give 80% to quora and 20% to games. I love quora",positive
"This app is good and have a nice and easy-to-use interface, which give a better experience of answering/asking question (even though i like their website more)",positive
"Quora is a fabulous app if you want to be involved and still great if you just want to watch and read. The site discusses so many things, as light hearted or as deep as you like. A great place for so many topics.",positive
easy to use. nice layout. setting options and notifications is simple to do.,positive
I can't read my feed without installing the app? Your website is not that important. I'll have to delete my account if there's no way I can read my feed through a browser.,negative
Tried using with chrome and kept getting popups to download the app and it wouldn't let me close the popup. Next steps are deleting this app and not returning to quora on chrome.,negative
"Overall, pretty decent. The community is great, there's plenty of sensible and knowledgeable people on here, and its usually very user friendly. Only problem is on mobile the site hates you not having the app, so you're forced to use it. Bad form.",positive
"It is awesome app regarding to it's features connects the entire world all together, if anyone has a problem can ask the corresponding experts of the field and make clear it. I got the solution mostly from this app during my study time.",positive
"Excellent app.... Instead spend time in Facebook or Instagram, better we can spend time in quora and develop our knowledge and ignorance....",positive
Please add dark mode settings in app I can't read during the night time. White background disturbs my sleeping pattern. Overall experience is great.,neutral
The editors don't allow using the old interface.....if there is an update then let it remain there and let others use the application in spite of not updating it.,negative
"I liked the app before I realized that it's having serious memory leakage or related issues. I will be writing a long answer to a question and it will start to freeze, go non-responsive, trigger Android's crash warning system, and/or start mushing my words together. That's incredibly frustrating and has made me give up before on giving an answer I'd been working on for a while. It literally just happened again. Please fix this.",negative
This app is an EMBARRASSING attempt to take what no longer will work on Chrome for Android by turning it into an app that won't work as an app on Android devices. Terrible!,negative
"This is spam, email appears inbox, never signed up for it cannot inscribed from email. Can find how the they got my email details.",negative
"Downloaded the app initially because website performance is atrocious, with typing a message having lag spikes upward of 10 seconds (presumably to promote the app) App just crashed twice in a 10 minute timespan just browsing questions before asking me to rate it (in general it crashes on a regular basis, this was just a striking example of my experience with it) And that's not to mention the multitude of issues with bots/spam questions people have highlighted that go unaddressed",negative
"I have a great experience with this social media. I mean this is a true social media. Because Facebook and Instagram are just made to get addict not to connect peoples. But quora is actual social media, it connects the people by their opinions, review and ideas. And people ask questions, people answer them. This is a great stage to purchase ideas. I love it.",positive
It is the best platform for sharing of knowledge. I have deactivated my fb account & now spending my quality time with quora,positive
Good app. Definitely better than using their website in a browser. Big downside for me is the lack of a Dark Mode. I like to read in bed and the white background is still bright with the backlight turned all the way down. Add this and it's almost perfect.,positive
So basically if I want to read an article I need this app. Stupid and useless. Even on chrome a pop-up appears and it blocks the content the only iptions provided being to open the app or download it. This is a very fascistic way of doing thing.,negative
"I'm so glad I found QUORA I have connected with so many people and learned things about my hobbies, my work and my interests that have helped me and inspired me. It's so addictive! I would never be without it. QUORA rules! üòä",positive
"Just downloaded and it seems interesting, however one thing I've noticed right away that you can't turn it horizontally to use your keyboard. I have large fingers and doing it vertically is very difficult for me. I will update this the more I use it.",neutral
"I love using quora on my phone as its more convenient to get information and write up an article, however i have been having bugs while typing out an article which is VERY annoying, because every time i backspace or space, the text warps all over the place and gets typed everywhere except for in the intended area. I would seriously like a fix on this, thank you",positive
Mind blowing app. Its like mini Google where u can find answers for whatever the question is. It helped a lot for my project work. Thanks a lot,positive
It not responsive. Freezes all the time. Moreover quora forces me to download the app when I'm going through the news feed.,negative
"Very detailed discussion is going on in the app on all areas, whether it is on about science n technology, history, geography, or about warfare and defence and other areas of the society. Quora to keep it up.",positive
"Fun informative, can really freeze up your phone im not sure why that is tho one ive typed about 3-4 paragraphs my phone starts bugging out",negative
"As a knowledge sharing Social Network this is OK, though it won't grow until it's better moderated. There are too many idiots posting replies along the lines of ""Why don't you Google the answer?"" Clearly the question asker is perfectly capable of researching topics online. There are also too many 'experts' who are anything but. But my main gripe is this app handles background memory appallingly. 76 MB of RAM for a lightweight browser app that constantly freezes? It's embarrassing.",negative
"Great content, but i easily lose track of I'm reading due to not-so-great navigation, history and categorization of content",negative
"Firstly they are forcing me to install the app, now after every few days I getting a screen to update my app, or else I cannot read their stuff.",negative
"‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶≤‡ßã, ‡¶§‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶â‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶Ç ‡¶Ö‡¶≠‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ßç‡¶û‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã ‡¶®‡¶æ, ‡¶ñ‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶á ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßã! Interface is laggy! Comments, reply everything is slow! Make it fast",negative
This is a wonderful application. It not only satiates your thirst for knowledge but also provides a peer reviewed platform to share your thoughts and information with the rest of the world.,positive
"One of best app for readers. I learn lots of things from it. And nowdays i am too addicted for reading many blogs on this app. But the issue is that app developer doesn't remove glitches from the app. App stop working after few minutes. My phone model is Redmi 4, please help me to know the issue. Glitchessssss ....",positive
i love this place. throw away face book and Twitter.if you love spending time having or reading INTELEGENT conversations and interesting people from all over the world.great rooms just for a teens with questions or the need for conversations.,positive
"Used to be fun, but the ""can't load page"" errors seem to be getting ever worse, and it's a now hell-hole of inane time wasting spam that Quora incredulously pay for via the ill-conceived partner programme",negative
"The best app for real knowledge seekers. Not for time pass purpose. If you want to pass your time, please find tik tok or Facebook or Snapchat.",positive
app is not wotking properly. there is only two news is shown in my home and it does not load more news after tapping on view more option.,negative
One of the best app l have used till date. Answers almost every question that one can think of..My experience with this app is amazing.Very useful app for evryone!üëåüëåüëåüëåüí•üí•üí•üí•,positive
"What kind of nonsense is this, first you send the email once we click on it and try to read the topic there will be a pop to download the quora app, though I have downloaded it to just pass this comment and ratings.",negative
Could have given 5 stars but not as it does not have dark mode. It will be very useful during night time. I request please add dark mode in the coming update... Thank you...,positive
Better if it has a night mode theme. It really hurts my eyes whenever I open the app.,negative
"Quora is a connection to infomation, a dicussion site for a wide variety of topics, and more. I love the depth of information available.",positive
I have the app on my phone and not on my tablet. Sometimes l will read it on my tablet. I notice now that a pop up on the tablet tries to force me to install the app if l want to read it there. This is a form of bullying. I won't be installing it but l am considering uninstalling it on my phone. I have an intense hatred for this type of bullying.,negative
This app is amazing and so freaking useful. It would be really great if they bring dark mode or reading mode to this app!,positive
I love the website but the app is lacking dark mode and has no save offline of the articles.. Please implement this feature,negative
"App experience is pathetic. Typing in hindi becomes slower with increase in typed length. After certain length it becomes so laggy that typing a single alphabet takes 2-3 second to appear and it becomes imposaible to type. Insted I have to use voice typing which doesn't lag. Apart from this opening an article, expanding comment etc is very slow and takes too much internet data. Scrolling is also laggy. I have 3GB RAM phone. This app should be optimised for low end phones also.",negative
It's just a kind of meeting the greatest minds and listening to the someone's experiences and getting the good suggestion from one thing .,positive
It's great to find a place where it's valued to share stuff that can't be shared (in general)! And to find that one is not alone.,positive
"I just want to browse the website. You can't look at more than 1 question at a time without the app being shoveled down your throat. I already gave you my email, and i don't want your stupid app...!!",negative
"There is nothing wrong with the app or how it works, I love it, but the optimalisation... When I type an answer I get into terrible lags, like what the hell I'm typing, everything else is closed, two gigs of ram free on an octa core phone, how can this app even consider slowing down for a moment. I decided to write this rating after two pages long answer got lost when the app killed itself few moments ago. If it does this to you just write it down in notes, copy paste, add images and post.",negative
Forcing your users to download the app is not the best strategy. Very annoying pop up.,negative
I enjoyed reading on my browser through my email until I was forced to install the app or quit reading. So I installed only to write this review then I'm going to uninstall and unsubscribe from all Quora emails. Nice job. Bad bad move. I don't like being forced to install apps I don't want. You guys are blowing it. I may have installed your app if you merely requested it. Not forced. Now I want nothing to do with Quora whatsoever. Drop the obnoxious 'force to install' pop-up. It's totally lame.,negative
I really dig this application. A very insightful app with tons of information from credible sources for the most part. The application itself also presents a fluid user interface and makes a good attempt to deliver a decent user experience... (It fails in some areas although I'm certain that improvements will be heading our way üôÇ),positive
"Great place to learn many interesting facts and opinions. Has become one of my favorite ""go to"" places.",positive
"It's really awesome you can just have everything you want, better than waste of time on Tiktok etc really aultra legend app",positive
"It is good and informative. But some of the photos aren't visible and cannot be seen. For example, the profile picture of the person who answered the question was blank. Also, pictures included in the answer, some of them are missing. Please fix this problem.",negative
This application is too much helpful For those kind of people who wants to learn creative things. But only problem is that this application needs too much MB. The developers should make this app totally free. And one ans should show to all in a time so that a answer can get enough view.,neutral
"Rapidly circling the drain thanks to encouraging spam at every turn. The Partner Program is singlehandedly responsible for lowering the quality of content by half, if not more so. There's still plenty of good content, but their corporate policies are disgustingly myopic and I fear for the future of the service.",negative
The degree of knowledge and sharing through Quora blows my mind away. The technology to drive ignornace and arouse curiosity in todays day and age is deeply needed and sustained. Thanks a lot,positive
Some questions and answers are useful. But sometimes it seems that people just make up any silly question they can think of!,negative
"I absolutely love this platform, only thing i dislike is the algorithm it uses to order posts on my feed. I mostly get the worst posts on top. Also the position of ads is really annoying.",negative
"I liked the contents, feels search is not that good. No proper options search specific questions and answers.",negative
"I cant add a question, comment on a post and view more feeds. Whenever i click on anything, it doesn't respond. Its just so annoying .",negative
Love it love learning about all sorts of random things and reading people's stories and personal experience s,positive
Why force someone to download your app if they are happy with emails and web browser. I downloaded to review now I also will uninstall and unsubscribe. I do not want your app or Yelp must be run by the same people.,negative
Was no longer able to read the emails sent and had not downloaded the app due to insufficient space.. Was forced to download the app finally....now after installation notification messages cannot be opened or regulated..,negative
Just killing my time to gain knowledge. Addicted such as lost in other world. It is must have app for everyone those who can spread knowledge through out the world and those are fond of learing everyday.,negative
"The app functionality is actually fine - the annoying ""use the app"" screening in chrome is annoying and not consumer friendly",negative
"Seemingly impossible to read on Quora on a smartphone's browser. No, it forces you to download the app to read the entire thing.",negative
Was forced to download this app to continue viewing the website. As enjoyable as the site is you can't get away with shoving an app down my throat because I want to view a couple of topics. A regular user would happily download this.. I'm not.,negative
Pathetic experience in User interface. If I'm logged in my browser. Why i am forced to install app. Without that I'm not able to continue. I just want to checke on browser only. Give us some solution,negative
"I love Quora. I love that people can go somewhere and ask for advice without having to find out how to pay for counseling. And I love seeing how my peers handle their own issues. The app is well designed and efficient in its workings and offers a genuinely helpful service. Instead of some dumb game that simply checks you out, you get a healthy interaction with your peers. That is MUCH more important than playing games. And just might make you smarter! So go ask a question and watch the magic.",positive
Great source of information and perspectives. Quora partner program has been great as well but i thought initially that 5 USD was the minimum to get payout.,positive
I personally refuse to download this app due to the fact that it forces me to go the play store if I want to scroll through the quora posts spammed to my email. I'd have downloaded it months ago if not for this a**hole design,negative
"Content is great, but App is worst! Seriously... Too heavy.. too slow.. And even after hundreds of updates and thousands of requests and complaints also, they did't add a dark theme and text size adjustment option.",negative
Content is good but worst app doesn't work properly takes too much time to load hence i use to access it through website and from feedback in gmail,negative
"I downloaded this app unwillingly because even though I used to love reading stuff on quora, today it forced me to download the app with no other option to close the pop up ad. So only 2 stars for being rude and forceful.",negative
"Buggy update. Photos simply dont load, despite my network being a superfast 4G with Speedtest results=17 mbps.",negative
"The app is amazing and all but i gave three stars because you forced me to download it. Everytime i try to answer a question, it pops that i should download the app and that is very rude.",negative
"Every thing is msrvalous , except with this app that while writing an answer , if just go out, then it becomes very difficult to go back to the draft. Ofcourse I have oflate been in to the Quira world!",negative
I have the app but in the middle of articles it ask if I want to download the app and won't let me finish the article.,negative
The app hangs and stutters. The editor is fussy: randomly closing the keyboard and formatting in every keystroke. It feels dated,negative
I always used quora on google but it won't let me to search anything without giving a pop up to install the app. I like the website but you should not force anyone to install your app,negative
Its a awesome app where people exchange their knowledge .I gain a lot of interesting things to know everyday as well as i am able to clear all my doubts .No issues with the app.,positive
Read that many books to scool children. Feed that many meals to the hungry. Give away that many warm coats or blankets.,negative
Submit and save button within the app isnt working . You guys Need to rectify this as soon as possible . This is Ruining the intrest of minw in this app,negative
Awesome app but new version takes more time to load the feed than the previous version..hope the developer fix it. It has helped me to knoe about many things I'm various domain and other people thoughts about it. Thanks for creating a great place like this.,positive
"Nice app to get opinions of strangers. Coming from someone you don't know leaves out judgement or being ""inside the box"". I also like reading others questions/answers to see other peoples p.o.v. 4 stars cuz I haven't gotten many responses to questions that I have posted.",positive
"This is really a great app. But i am actually a bit sad that i asked 2 questions but didn't got the answer of anyone in which one question was seriously urgent, otherwise it is a great app and i loved it.",positive
"Great app, minor change needed, there are lots of people sharing nudity and vulgarity that should be removed. Otherwise its great platform to share knowledge.",positive
"Wrost experince, when i click anywhere its dosen't work. I can't share my link. In every thing i am facing problems. Even i have an updated version of quora.",negative
Unable to reach the server. Connection issues on Quota side. My other Apps are fine. I am able cto post in my browser but not the app. Continued problems trying to log into the Quota App!,negative
WORST USER EXPERIENCE. Why you have to block the website by annoying pop ups that can't be closed!!!! I'm really pissed and want to quit Quora.,negative
"From 2 days,the pages are not responding even my network speed is good.I am a regular user of quora and I furstated to wait a longer time then they show page not responded.please fix it ASAP.",negative
The one stop place for any question that anyone can have. A broad array of topics are answered by users. Anything and almost everything. Wish that search function was more effective which could possibly prevent redundancy,positive
"Everything about the app is good. I have two concerns, I would like have a feature to save several answers for offline reading. Quora team please provide us with the above feature in upcoming update. One more important inevitable thing is dark mode, as a predominant reading app dark mode is essential and it helps us with lot of reading. Right now it hurts the eyes if used for a longer period of time.",positive
"Love the info and the users also, could be a great source with the unfortunate exception of the app creators requiring the app download. That people is a fatal error to do in an age where plenty of other resources bidding on the number one position. Bad move quora..... nice while it lasted but onto the more polite info resource soon to make this website utterly useless.",positive
An amazing platform with all kinds of information. Very addictive app for those who never stop learning.,positive
"I was using quora on web... I liked it and installed the app... But in the app there was limited amswers on one page... And i was not able to upvote/ downvote answers ,follow /unfollow someone..bookmarks are not opening properly... .dont know whts the issue but it was worst experience... Uninstalling now...",negative
Stop making it mandatory to update your app in order to use it. It's a cheap way and your app really is not that important. Grow up.,negative
Even if internet speed is good but this app works extremely slow while loading contents which is quite irritating.,negative
It is very useful to children's and adults. We will get answers for our questions and as well as interact with genuine people.,positive
Constant nagging to install this even if you already have it. The app hog battey resources and interferes with the use of my phone. Dont need it stick to using a safer browswer. Uninstalled after so much nagging.,negative
"Please add Dark Mode feature soon. The app is already great function wise, I just need Dark Mode to read more comfortably at night rather than getting blinded by the crazy white background. Thank you devs!",positive
"I found a lot of answers with wide range of view points, still i wish if there were an AI who can give the final right answer or at least the most accurate one among the answers!",positive
"Good ap for the most part, but because I am a pretty heavy user on a tablet, I find it very frustrating that it won't switch to landscape mode.",negative
Great way to exchange information. But too slow and had lag issue when writing and posting... Even slow when loading the page,negative
The latest version of app sucks... Not able to read the contents in Notifs tab. The page is loading for so many hours.,negative
this is very poor app; it is not go anywhere on the articlesall it does is next next next you never finish the article or the very very give you1/2 *not not 1 *only 1/2 *,negative

"The app is great, but I am not a regular quora user. But whenever I try to look up to an answer in web browser once in a while, I am forced to install this app. Why should I install an app that I would need only once a month for opening a webpage!?",negative
The site has changed over the years when they added the income part. It has drastically changed the level of questions and answers.,neutral
I think it's high time everyone aired their own views rather than bottle things up. One place to speak to the world from with your hands.,neutral
Can't open quora on mobile without using the app. It's really unnecessary and frustrating. I just installed the app to leave this review. Will uninstall it now.,negative
"The app freezes on moving to different answers, this needs improvement, especially on android",negative
The quora website is forcing you to download app to read online on the phone. I hate this feature of developer. So i am installing it. I will give one star for the app and will uninstall the app. So that they remove this feature of forcing you to download the app. Kindly you all do the same.,negative
"I'm attempting to read quora from their site, as I deleted the app due to space constraints on my phone. I get partially through a story only to be automatically sent to the Play Store to redownload it, even after ""x""ing out of ""open in app"". Extremely annoying!",negative
Very easy to use. This app give you every detail that you want. You can search anything about subject matter in this app. And you can use this app to read online.,positive
"Really good app, I pass so much time on it reading stuff! The app works better than the website, making everything easier.",positive
The platform which solely based on knowledge sharing and reading doesn't provide a dark or dim mode so we can read more every time! Suffer till we see any better outlook.,negative
"When I have landed on quora I found out one of the best think is now days all are extraordinary writers. It is good platform as to experience the others experience through words. People are writing their own story at nude level which is very interesting. Quora consider this, we want more way to writing story at interesting level. Another thing I like more QUORA is getting information.",positive
This app is a writing app and the developers don't even have the courtesy to write what's new in every update they offer..,negative
"BEST LEARNING INSTRUMENT but we need recently activity option or history, dark mode and learning group.",neutral

"Wow!. This is probably one of the first apps that I've given recognition of a good Review. I'm actually really excited standing in the middle of the pouring rain actually using my knowledge of the English language I try to help more people to discover a port inward. Honestly, I have just gotten to the breaking point where I NEED my life to be a certain way and I don't know how to do, it so I'm asking for help from Quora's larger collective consciousness.",positive
Lots of bugs in the current version. When i tap the 'load more' option at the bottom it doesn't do anything.,negative
"Please add a night mode, it'll make life much easier :-) Edit: It's 2020 now still no night mode. No uniform theme regarding the answer window between digest and main feed. Do the app devs not use the app themselves? Lots of small issues which make using the app a headache. If anybody from the Dev team is reading this feel free to reach out to me I have a bunch of suggestions for you guys.",negative
Please add a feature where I can go through my unread notifs one by one. Two arrows at the bottom of the screen in case I want to go back or go to the next one and the counter too that shows how many more unread notifs I have. I feel like I'm missing so much now because I don't know how much unread notifs I have once I open the first one. Kindly look into this. Thanks,neutral
I have learned a lot about how the questions are answered. By sharing experiences and learning from them makes one wiser and more intelligent.,positive
Its a great app for learning things of interest and also new things... The only problem to me is it take sometime to load contents and also I wish they add an offline feature,positive
I like it but you can sometimes get some answers that are posted by blind idiots especially to serious questions. But overall it is educational and entertaining. But I just wish some people would just post their comments in plain language and not use big words or phrases that normal people cannot understand.,neutral
"Pretty great app for someone who has OCD and wants answers to insanely particular questions within a few hours, which cannot be found by a quick Google search. Answers by members seen to be generally accurate.",positive
It's been very wonderful and highly educational. It comes highly recommended. I have learned a lot from people sharing wonderful experiences and getting good responses from answers provided by experts. I look forward to reading from Quora everyday.,positive
To do justice to Quora i would say it's an excellent platform where one comes across questions and experiences of people all over the world.they are so practical and optimistic( generally). people from all over the world share their views and experiences which I'm sure many of us can take a lesson.actually one has to just log on to Quora to find a solution to one's problem! I think its a great app.thanks Quora!,positive
"I love to read about experiences of others and share mine as well. I have learnt a lot from reading about spiritual growth, about problems of other people around the world and how to handle life matters more wisely. I have learnt that we are not much different afterall. Additional to that, I can also contribute my opinions related to the problems of others.",positive
Why You are forcing us to download the app ? Even after downloading app can't able to sign in. Quora used very good but time to time it's decreases its value to its users. So without sign in I can only see one answer . You should be serious at this issues otherwise you are gonna down . I just download app for leaving a review. And now uninstalling this worst App,negative
Recent update broke the view. Continue Reading button takes user to top of screen without expanding section.,negative
Getting too many emails from quora no matter how many times i unsubscribe or turn off email notification in preferences. Very annoying.,negative
"App is totally good in functioning ,features and gives users to view quite good questions and answers and also putting their own views.",positive

Forced to use the app because of the unhideable overlays in the web version... Why would you ever do it this way?,negative

"Seems like a great place to get a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th opinion on something... But also a great place to give your opinion as well.",positive
"No dark mode, no split screen mode, filled with useless ads.

I just don't know what to tell you about my experience with Quora. My first visits were 5 stars. Great people and ideas. You can read about anything you could conceivably imagine! Was taken over by my inner writer. A few days ago I couldn't browse or comment with out being commanded to delete it. Being ordered to fill out my -credentials' before anything and would find my takes on events in my life gone.To top it off it was very difficult to maneuver on my quest to Quora to be... VERIFIED???,positive
"all the extra advertisements and articles makes it lesser good than before. The content quality has gone down, its mostly about sex nowadays. It should change, like it was before, full of classy contents. Advertisement is understandable because you need to pay people, but their should definately be something for the quality check.",negative
"The application is very vast and diversified, very well articulated articles and to the point answers. You've all the answers for the questions that you raise. Highly recommendable , go for it.",positive
This is fun. But it can get old. Do it like homework-- do each assignment err question and take a break.,positive
Even though Quora doesn't contain pictures in most of the answers ...it takes lot of time to update the feed .My suggestion is it should be more robust.,negative

1 doesn't send me emails anymore for some reason and I downloaded the app because on the website it keeps showing the logo in the middle of my screen telling me to download the app which prevents me from reading and you have to reenter the app to get rid of it and you have to update the app in order to use it,negative
Its not fair how the website mercilessly redirects me to playstore every 2 minutes to download the app. The UX design is poor. Too intrusive,negative
I hate this app so much because a bunch of inappropriate photos popped up a soon as I signed up.,negative
"The app does what it was intended to do, but it has many failings. First, you can't filter anonymous users, which is sad - those who post anonymously are less likely to contribute anything of value, and are often trolls. Second, the categories which exist for reporting inappropriate content don't match the types of content which most deserve reporting. Third, content spamming is incentivized, so many users submit hundreds of questions of the 'What's the capital of Finland?' variety.",negative
"Love the app, but the partner program aided spam questions make it almost completely worthless.",negative
"App is just not loading, just stops responding after a complete white screen, tried reinstalling and checking my data and permissions, nothing seems to be working.",negative

It ask u to follow crab in order to get the result , they after many steps , they tell you to log out of facebook , search for the persons Facebook copy the url, then log in and past the url, if it says sorry we couldn't find this person. That's mean he blocked u. Are u hidden me ? If I have worse than 1 star , I would give that",negative

It covers everything.You can get knowledge about everything and ask questions... I highly recommend it.,positive
A very good app to ask question and get answers. But the only thing that its lacking is a dark theme. While reading content for long time it fells very stressful to eyes and we shut it down.,negative
I am just mesmerized by the beauty of quora. It is a perfect platform where you can access knowledge from different aspects of life. We can explore everything by only entering into it. I have come to know various things about which I was unaware. In one word it is UNPRECEDENTED to use in comparison to other apps. It's a one_click_knowledge!!!,positive
Bookmarks sections refuses to load in my app everyone I click on the tab.. It's updated and has no other issues..,neutral
"Huge laggs especially when writing through a smartphone long text...I mean it just text it's not normal. Some functionalities are missing like how to tag a question private or public, same on profile there's some history that appears but a lot is missing somehow.

Some ""rooms"" you are subscribed to don't appear on phone version anymore. Redundant questions",negative
"First got Quora when I was about 16, and it gave me a view of the totally different world outside Montana. There are a lot of great people worth listening to on this app, and my life wouldn't have been the same without it.",positive
"Downloading the app is compolsury, you can not use the website on phone, which I find really disgusting... Also unable to use without updating every new versions!",negative
"Just came here from Quora website to rate the app because it won't let me browse. A persistent pop up asking to download the app, not letting me scroll is the reason for the rating. Why would I download an app for a website that I use once in a Blue moon?",negative

"Didn't want this app to begin with, but Quora's site would block my entire browser window with an ad forcing me to either install this app or back out of the page. After months of backing out of the page, i finally get the app and discover its 1. Bright white with no option for dark mode, 2. Doesn't have a good interface because some frames take up too much screen when trying to read answers, and 3. IT IS SO SLOW. The lag is unbelievable and the app is unusable. I'm uninstalling now.",negative
"This apps is barely optimized, lag when typing long answer, high data usage, poor memory management, you name it this app has it",negative
Wrote a few answers that helped a lot of people. Then someone reported my name. That was when I learned that I could not go by my nickname on there. So those answers that helped others? Gone. Completely nuked my answers and stats. If you do not use your real name or feel comfortable doing so (I wasn't since when I merely google my name it pulls up my address) then this is absolutely not the site for you. So much for helping others. :(,negative
"The website kept pestering me to get the app, so I finally did. The only useful thing about the app is the ability to close the question you looked at and go back to the Notification screen. The Home and Answer screens are next to useless. The app insists you have items waiting for attention, but if you click to go to those pages, there's nothing waiting for you, and yet the item-waiting count doesn't clear. Too annoying!",negative

Very serious but quite a few lies to important questions. Also they don't like me cuz I'm not using my real name but they don't understand that I have a DEATH NOTE and it can't be good for me to reveal my real name to the internet also I don't like it so I can't have fun I guess.,negative
"I signed up for an account, as you forced us to, but that wasn't enough? Now if we want to read more, you shove an ad for your lousy app in our face. That doesn't encourage me to install it. In fact, it makes me want to stop using Quora, completely. Stop being trash, be happy we signed up. I was satisfied with my experience until you got greedy.",negative

"Irritating app. Keeps blocking with the pop up asking me to ""Get the app"" when I ALREADY HAVE THE APP!",negative
I like it. It's fun to read different answers. I'm asked fairly often to answer questions. I usually don't mind unless it's something I have absolutely no interest in or the questions are very poorly/vaguely written. I'd rate it higher if someone did a reality check on questions.,positive
If I am using your website then why are you forcing to download app I like website more than your app because app is slower than my browser.,negative
Awesome! This app just changed my lifestyle in a positive way thank. This is the destination for improving your writing skills and IQ. Great app.,positive

I have downloaded because it's not letting me to other feeds without downloading. Very irritating and shameful marketing tactics. Really shame on you people,negative

really great app. has got answers to almost all of your queries. Great time killer in a very intellectual way.,positive
I downloaded this just to give you 1 star. Why are you forcing us to use this app? We can't open some articles if we don't use this app. I don't want to use an app on every website I visit. This is stupid. 1 star and uninstalling.,negative
"The app great, but I am edditing my review from 5 Star to 3 Star, as the app forces you to download it whenever I am trying to go through someone's comments on the browser, please don't do it. I have faced the same issue with my IPAD also. Even my friend got irritated by this behavior. Kindly provide ""suggestion"" to view someone's answer on App (instead of forcing the person, that now he can't see the answer on the quora website, and now download the app). Not a good way to deal with customer",negative
"I think it's bad enough that once you accidentally downvote what you were reading, then you can't find it again. So yeah..I lost the vital Information I was going through and I've searched Google countless times but still can't find the info anymore. Fix your app! Downvoting something accidentally or not, a prompt should be displayed to never see it again! It really shouldn't be hard to implement in the app.",negative

"Forced to download this to stop annoying pop up blocking use of the normal site. More intrusive, not liked or wanted.",negative
I wish I could give 0 stars! And that is because I am forced to use this app while the website keeps opening a modal saying go use our app! Sure I can open every new page in Incognito mode but that also sucks a huge amount of my time.,negative
This is a useful web portal...but is also very biased in favour of Xtians and Americans ..that's totally against the neutrality stand that a site like this must adopt!!,negative
"Very bad experience. Does not allow you to view questions in web browser even though logged in. Forces you to use app. Frankly speaking this my first ever app review on play store and Quora's frustrating lead capturing strategy forced me to do it. Quora please keep this in mind while designing app or websites never force a user, they are the ultimate authority, if you want us to use the app suggest it don't force it, it's frustrating.",negative
I think it's the best single place for a discussion on any random subject. I like that you can ask specific people things (though they may or may not respond).,positive

I may have to download something else to ask my questions,positive
It has started hanging a lot. Despite clicking an answer numerous times it doesn't open. Also when you click an answer another answer get opened. Please resolve this issue asap.,negative
"One star rating because I was forced (by an unclosable popup) to download the app rather than continue to use chrome to answer a question. Its quoras site, and it's their right to require people to download useless bloatware in order to use it. But they shouldn't expect anything but 1 star from the people that they inconvenience",negative
"The app requires internet at a crazy speed to load answers from the notification tab or even for the notification to be automatically marked as read. Website is much faster so I uninstalled the app to browse on the website.

Probably one of the worst commercial apps i have ever used. Completely non-functional on a flagship phone. Have tried al the troubleshooting tricks with no progress. Now qoura wont serve the webpage even if its asking for desktop site so u guess its completely useless now. Too bad i really liked the idea of this site,negative
"Stop forcing us to download your App! It's very irritating while going through articles . Let a person have a freedom to choose ,if needed one shall download your app, for a temporary need website suffice. JUST STOP!",negative
What we can learn from this situation: Forcing users to install their app leads to an increment in 1 üåü rating. And quora will be a great example in business schools to not follow these tactics ever in your life.,neutral
"Could you please not redirect every quora answer to your app, its really annoying , please dont force us to use the app, if we are searching in a browser then we want to stay in the browser",negative
Complete waste of my time and phone storage. I was using the website to read an article when I was forced to download the app in order to read it. Why have a website if you cant even use it? Utter waste of my phones storage just to read an article. Uninstalled immediately after.,negative
This Quora is also a website but when you go on the website it literally forces you to download the app for you to read replies which is just wrong. So here I am. I've downloaded it and I'm giving it one star (happy now?)especially because the app is much below my expectations.,negative
I have to say this is so not kid friendly. Due to the language but it's funny and Answers take a long time but it's okay,negative
Really agressive advertising. Wont let anyone surf Quora website without forcing you download the app. Whats the point of the website if you can't access it. Really frustrating. Because of this i miss so many important links. I wont search something on Qoura app specifically. I google it and it gives links to qoura. Thats how qoura is helpful.,negative
A lot of it is interesting but there are too many ads and the content is a little too American.,negative
"I liked to reading Quora on website before. Because sometimes i need other people perspective on some topics that i searched into. But now, they forced me to download their apps on the website. Also, the notifications were annoyed me so much. Quora was awful",negative
"I generally enjoy Quora, but do not like the character limit on questions, while endless, endless, run-on answers are not questioned. Some are so long that I close out, don't have the time. At least longer questions should be allowed. There is also a lot of bad language that appears in some answers, and not knowing whether or not there are consequences to this, I don't like it, it's unnecessary. I just noticed there is a limit on the size of this review, as well. Sigh.",negative
"Whenever I open an article to read, it takes too much time to process & even after opening, it looks like the app gets confused with which article i have clicked because it starts juggling through previous article which i have opened first & then coming back to the article I have clicked, I am using an updated pocofone f1 6gb rom",negative
"The pop-up gets annoying. It always asks me to download the app first, and then continue reading the answers. I had no other choice but to download it.",negative
"I gave this review having never opened the app, simply because even if the app works perfectly and is exceedingly efficient in its purpose, the fact that I was required to download the app, with absolutely no alternative or option to dissent, just to read the conversation string I was interested in is ridiculous, manipulative, and pointless. Especially given that the atrticle exists in sufficient form and I was already there.",negative
Stupid app does not allow you to read content on website. It forces you to download app while reading website. So one star for that.,negative
It's more fun than I thought it would be... It's like conversing with a search engine and also like actually BEING a really slow and picky one. there are A LOT of ads but they blend in... almost too well... ü§®,positive
I have been using quora for few years. It has been great except it doesn't support older version of iOS and andoid. The app takes less space and installing is quite easy,positive
This is a very good apps and its very educative too. i love it very much. It teaches people many things and gives you many more true.,positive
"Best place to get information. You can easily find informative and well written answers on varying topics ranging for science, philosophy, health or anything else you can think of. If what you're looking for is not on the site you can simply submit your own question.",positive
Very informative and i came to know those things which were unkmown to me for a long time simply just fantastic app for my electeical field keep it up!üëç,positive
"Sometimes the questions are good and interesting but a lot of the time they are stupid rubbish questions that can be answered with a simple Google search in a couple of minutes . A lot of the more rubbish questions are asked by the same person over and over again. I think the site introduced some sort of reward program and that is the only reason the silly questions are asked, not asked from an interest point of view just for the rewards . It has ruined this site , used to be good with a lot of",negative
"Whenever I open quora app, it says download the app in spite having downloaded it. Even if I click on 'I have downloaded this app' , it takes me to playstore for no reason and if I use quora app again, again it ask to download app. Do solve this bug or else i will uninstall it. Inspite writing this, there is no change. Very bad app. It should be given -10 score.",negative
"Only one answer loads for each question; can't get the app to load other answers. Also valid for loading comments to answers. Please fix this bug, or at least don't enforce using the app on the website.",negative
"I installed it only to rate 1 star , why are you forcing users to download the app, at least give an option to close that annoying pop-up.",negative
"The app is large. As well as very buggy. Laggy. You're better off just using the Quora site, rather than the app. It needs a lot of work.",negative
"I enjoy reading the answers. By the way I cant answer the ""tell us more"" because the choices are only no and not sure - what happened to yes.",positive
Magnificent experience on daily basis I think after so many years using a smart phone finally got a perfect app. Started to spend my much time in it. I am noticing this that my mind is getting an direction . Which I think is good for me. Good luck to all team & thankyou.,positive
"When my debate speech was not ready, I was in a big trouble and the debate was on Thursday, this is when I used this app and it helped me a lot and I was able to give a very good speech, Thanks to whoever made this app may also be blessed my me. You guys have helped me a lot with this app. Thanks for making this appüíñüíñüíñ",positive
I was forced to install the app while reading something on the perfectly fine mobile site. Why a web company would do something like this is beyond me. This is a sure way to tank your app ratings and lose users.,negative
"I love the amazing contributors being so diverse, such a cross section of nationalities, cultures, religions, experience and education. Young, old, men, women..some in pain, and many are here to help. That is my desire, as I have written over 5,000 posts in support of stroke survivors, and those terminally ill, as I am. Following 4 strokes, I have found the forum to be confusing to start using, and I have uninstalled it, missed it and am back to try again!",positive
Good but can also get rather one sided and an echo chamber of spectacularly sounding stories and quite full of cleverly hidden and deceptive ads nowadays which are annoyingly repetitive.,negative
Worst q&a site available. They do not allow individual or unique questions or specific details to how the question might relate to you or a problem. They are collecting user data and monetizing it. I would strongly reccomend Yahoo Answers over this.,negative
Annoying AF in the middle of an article and they give you two options both lead to you downloading the app. I don't want to have to download an app just to read a random article.,negative
"Great just new at looking at these sites, but I am enjoying the chance to learn new things, cheers from Australia",positive
"After the recent update,the notification number always stays 10 irrespective of how much ever notifications received. Please correct this",negative
If you want to read the whole comment again wait for it to load and it's a long process.. Answer is fine but experience on chrome is better then the app,neutral
"Wonderful. It's different from any other social forum in a sense that it is an unique combination of having an information source, at par with Google in certain aspects and the literary values of high order that relate various subjects of interest.",positive
It forces you to get the app I only down loaded to read one article then unistalled it again as I didn't want the app to start with,negative
"only downloaded the app to deactivate my account, very helpful if you are in need of help with schoolwork but otherwise a pain and sends constant emails of things i don't really care about.",negative
I just wanted to let you know that downloading app should be a choice. I hate when I'm reading something on quota on browser and Pop up comes just between and I don't have a choice to complete the answer without downloading the app. I hate it so much. I love the app but.......,negative
It's been so great for the last 2 years but recently it's giving me a lot of issues. So annoying!!! It becomes non responsive and also forces me to use the app when I clearly still want to be on the web. So annoying. A let down.,negative
This new UI is unusable. It is riddled with advertisements that are visually similar to real questions. Theres no premium version to get rid of them either. How can an app go from something so intuitive and great to this. Geez. Still love the community. <3,negative
Nice app It can be used for both entertainment and study purposes.,positive
I really like this app. It answers all the question that I have been curious about so I'm really grateful whomever make this app. Its really nice to have so many people opinion on one question so I get to see so many view. It's a nice app. I rate 5 stars !,positive
"This app is the best question forum application,very responsive and beautiful. Readily gives you accurate suggestions to your questions and appriopiate answers",positive
"It's alright sometimes, but I posted a question and your weird, poorly made ""auto correct"" thing edited a question I posted despite me clicking ""post original"" and COMPLETELY changed the meaning of said question, and the tone of the question. At least make the ""post original"" button ACTUALLY post the original all the time?",negative
"I was trying to read Quora in my web browser as I got rid of the app so that I would not overuse it, asI have in the past. But the site seems to require the app if you read for more than s couple of minutes, in the form of a pop-up I can't get of. This is incredibly intrusive. I, not the developers decide what I load on my phone This incident is an excellent example of why I should find an alternative site...",negative
Excellent app. Although it depends on how you use it. Great questions and answers. I've experienced issue while loading images and sometimes text also. Content wise great app. Supporting regional languages is cherry on the cake.,positive
There are lot of bugs in this update. When i press 'view more' at the bottom of my feed nothing shows up. Please Fix ASAP!,negative
Sorry.. i didnot find any option to contact you. Thats why to get your responce i am giving u 1 star rating. I am facing an issue with the app. Earlier in the activity option we could see all our activities. I have voted many of writings/posts. I want to re read it . But now I can not see older posts which I have voted earlier. Only few posts are displaying. Guys please help. I need those articles. Please please I beg u. Please enable those option. Please please please,negative
I know I'm going to gain more experience with the subjects we discuss in the app but I'll really like things to be faster in the sense that I'm not going to wait for a long period of time before loading a page,positive
guys seriously improve search engine. you know i use google search on my phone for finding q and a. and it's the only way it works other wise it's impossible to find questions using search. this is a. only thing that stops me using your app . otherwise i find my self in quora for like hours.,negative
The best app that i find always helps to find answer of my curiosity nd also help to express mine own thoughts nd opinions.,positive
I was reading in browser but they forced me to keep trying to install the app. Its uncool and unprofessional. Don't try to force people to install the app.,negative
Pictures don't load most of the time. They load only when we click on the white space where the pictures are meant to load.,negative
"It Doesn't open. I installed ot, since i already have a quora account i tried to log in but i couldn't. After multiple failed tries, i thought of create a new account and i tiried to do it as well but it won't create a new account as well.",negative
"Liked the experience in web quora, hated it on mobile app. In web it always tells you to install the mobile app. My followed topics don't show in my explore and it was lagging although my connection was fine.",negative
Best learning app. Also best platform to share & explore the knowledge within you.,positive
I was reading some interesting things from my feed using a browser. All on a sudden a screen came up asking me to install mobile app and I can't do anything about that screen. Why do you force people to download your app why don't you just allow us to access Quora from whatever way we want. Such a stupid thing forcing me to download this app.,negative
I was forced to download the app. I will not be downloading the app and everyone please rate Quora with 1 star so they don't force their readers to download apps to read their content.,negative
"3 prompts in a row to login with Google account, there should be more, please make it an infinite loop!",negative
"Fix the bug. For MI4I mobile, when ever i open an answer the screen get faded and black and became normal on back Button (feed). Strange and weird. Fix this pls",negative
"This app is something I was forced to download to view the answer to a question. I hate this since I was happily browsing on Chrome on my mobile then the pop-up wouldn't go away. I'm pretty sure this isn't allowed but this company does so anyway. So until it's fixed, I hope this warning can alert people to not support such a morally horrid company.",negative
It's perfect. In everyway. Filled with life changing and bettering information,positive
I had to download the app just to post this review. Please stop forcing people to download the app while they are in the middle of reading something from your website. Very disappointing. Uninstalling now...,negative
A rare app.. In the time of countless useless apps... This app is best for serious & truth loving people... Loved this app more than any app... The best app online available.. Thanks to the owners for creating this brilliant platform. Great work.,positive
"Very useful app but these day i have problem with log in. Every time i tried to log in with google account it shows only one """"unable to reach the server please try again later"""" please fix this. I have problem with log in. And one day i manage to log in but then it dnt allow me to search any question and even i was not able to see my following/followers and cant write any answer. Please fix this.",negative
Very good platform for knowledge sharing and exchanging views.Can be made better by arranging the questions and answers in well organised heads and subheads,positive
Good place to open your eyes on various subjects. Use it more than Twitter and medium. (I'm not on Facebook),positive
"A lot more improvement and app user interface can be made effective. Mobile app writing and editing can still be improved. Advertising can be decreased Quality of questions can be monitored and encouraged. Coz, a good answer isn't possible without a good question. QnA. Quora. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è",positive
This app is so good when you're bored. I literally spend 3 hours a day listening to music and reading stuff there. Not paid to say this but 5/5 ez,positive
"Quora is good and all but the web browser version is better than the app. So I use browser but it keeps sending me to play store and keeps demanding to install the app for better viewing experience. But app isn't any better. Infact it is worse than this. It not only lags while writing answers and comments but also eats up most of my RAM, battery and internet data. So why should I install it? Please don't force users to install app. It's frustrating.",negative
I'm using this app from last 2 years and still there are lots of information i searched but not get good results.,negative
Perhaps I would have voluntarily tried the app with my limited phone storage space had I not been blocked from using Quora's website on my phone with the suggestion I download the app. Site works fine on my phone and by shoving the app in my face with no option B they have ensured I will use neither on a mobile platform.,neutral
Total BS forcing app use! Must be something highly profitable for them to force app use! Kind of enjoyed the reading but not these kind of activities. No more!,negative

"It's the world's most stupid website. First it won't let me read anything until I sign in. So I sign in. Then once I've signed in, it insists that I install the app. I can understand the sign in, at least a little bit, but don't the idiot developers realise that not everyone wants every stupid app for occasionally visited websites clogging up their phone. I installed it to write this review and will be uninstalling it again straight after. Well done, lost one more visitor. Great growth tactics.",negative
"I don't want your stupid app, stop with the pop ups on the website!!!!! Downloaded it only to post this negative review then uninstall it afterwards. Pro tip for the people who posted a review saying they had to install this: Cut the URL of the offending question you are trying to view, then repaste it and hit enter. This works for me on Samsung Internet.",negative
This is very bad don't download I tried it and turn out it like does what it says it do but they blame you for every little reason they blocked from editing for no reason,negative

Please just let me read the article on quora's website since I'm not using quora all the time for my convenience sake just let me use it through a browser as if I'm on my computer. I just need my questions answered that's all also you don't have to send me a newsletter all the time. I don't really need an app for a QnA service now do I.,neutral
Why the hell do you keep asking to download your app?? And if someone doesn't want to download it he/she can't purse the reading?? Earlier one could easily use quora over browser without any problem so why now......,negative

"Force us to download the app. Not a good impression. And the app shows an error. "" Quora is temporarily unavailable""",negative
I love this app! Having this app I notice myself becoming full of more knowledge based on the issues I have become curious about such as... BPD or narcissistic personalities.

The code and the development of the app is not good it takes a lot of time for the search results to get ready. I only installed the app because quora doesn't allow me to read in chrome. Quora has hit a hammer on its own leg by introducing this feature,negative

Think its b.s i am looking for a answer to a quick question and it wont remove the pop up to install the app...so forcing me to dl it to see a answer is only going to instantly uninstall it which i would most likely would of kept this ap but because of this its history....this also increases the dl counter as many people have probably done the same thing as me which counts as 1 dl making them look more popular then they are.run advertising and sell our information like everyone else lol,negative

"i gave two stars just because it seems rude to give 1, which is just what the app deserves to be really honest. I'm a Quora user since long and I write most of my answers with Android app, but this app is really laggy. During typing long answers the app lags a lot. A hell lot. It just needs to be re-written from scratch maybe using a different language, the current one isn't good.",negative
I need a answer ! Why do I download your application when I am using your quora from web. Why are you guys forcefully stuck on a page to download our app. Is there any rule! May I use your quora on web address ? Please for God sake don't force like that ...we already giving you business as much as we can. Don't follow the path that will never end.,negative
Garbage. I was trying to use your site & the ad for this ap popped up & no matter what I click it won't go away. I am not reloading to give you another dose of ad revenue I don't fall for benal pedantic tricks.,negative
"App is not loading feed. Cleared catch,force stopped,even reinstalled still nothing. Need assistance@quora customer representative it",negative
"The content platform is amazing. The app however consumes a lot of power. A ""night mode"" option would be really useful, given how a majority of the app background is white.",positive
"I was forced to download the app, whilst trying to read online. A cheap way to get downloads, if I say so myself. Unfortunately I'm a big fan of quora, it's unfortunate that it forces you to download an app.",negative
"Very poor UI,does not open the answers on a tap, browsers force you to move to app and app is so pathetic",negative
"After the new updates in my redmi note 8pro, the app is unable to open the direct answer but somehow it could open the shared answers. Please look into it.",negative
"Sometimes app fails to images, even at good internet speeds. And UI goes unresponsive even if you keep on tapping the answers or readmore links.",negative
Useful app for sharing ideas and clearing doubts! But very slow app. Many times it after clicking read more it takes too much time to open the answer.,negative
Ok when it works...which is becoming more of the exception than the rule. Quit fixing stuff that works...I can't even open an answer anymore.,negative
Better experience in this app so nice and give us a nice full information about the technology and give the idea about the study and it's give news about the world.,positive
"Every single time i approch your website ,there is a pop up download the app....disgusting bz i can't close that pop up by myself.....",negative

"I can't view any questions on my feed, problem which happened randomly, also viewing questions has a buggy feel.",negative

Bug in the app. Doesn't let me view the entire answer (Read more button isn't working),negative
"Quora sucks after this update, my internet speed is good , but whenever I tap on an answer it doesn't opens. Really very dissapointed to see this , very irritating update :$",negative
"I am not able to click on the answers and read them fully.I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app,still the problem continues.I don't know whether others are also facing this issue.Some technical error which needs to be corrected.",negative
"Why offer to browse at all if you're only going to block the screen wanting to get people to download the app? Btw, the app uses more battery than almost all the apps I have. Quite odd considering what this app is.",negative
No longer the same experience. The content on the feeds are not updated but the app asks for frequent updates.,negative
"Quora not working properly. Read more function not open, connect to Facebook note done and log out process not complete.",negative
Very helpful and easy. Thank you all for participating and sharing such abig experienced information,positive
I only downloaded the app to read an interesting answer. The app crashes all the time. I read the same reviews. Is there any action on it?,negative
unable to open answers by clicking 'read more'. also all the pictures in answer will not display. update ruined the experience.,negative
The app has great content...i've downloaded it yesterday and found wonderfull content..But the app has few problems 1.the follow option doesn't get clicked i had to click it so many times everytime 2.Only the home page is fast and shows all random posts..the notification page and the spaces page are not showing up AT ALL when selected... They are either blank or say there is no internet connection although the home page works and my phone has full signal...pls fix them,positive
"My quora was working fine, but recently when I open, it use to be stuck on loading and I have good internet connection. I uninstalled it and reinstall it again but still it is on loading screen like forever. I like the app it's amazing so educative but I can now use it no more.",negative
It is not working in my phone and the app is not opening at all. If opening I am unable to read the answers. Please solve the issue.,negative
Wonderful educational app but very badly built...I can see the developers trying to bring in changes..but it's taking too much time to open an article and dissapoints me while reading also too much time to load photos... I think if they could built app like Facebook Lite it would be great....,negative
"After last update, not able to expand any question/ answer. Went on the website and it redirected me to the app again.",negative
Thought downloading app would enhance user experience but it turned otherwise! Can't read any answers... Worse. Web is better but it keeps blocking from reading further.,negative
Not able to read any answers. Click is not working for any questions. I am tapping on the 3 line snippet and also tried clicking on read more but nothing happens,negative
"Latrat version is user unfriendly! Cant open articles, theyre unclickable. Fix this ASAP",negative
I give this app 4 star because it's a good way to get the information and interacting with unknown people.,positive
"Lately I cant seem to expand any answers to read them in full. Nothing works when I tap anywhere, except to comment and upvote. Not sure if its because my phone is not compatible or Quora is pilling up with bugs.",negative
"A great resource but since the last update read more just doesnt work can't read the answer the website gives a big get the app pop up which can't be removed, how is a user supposed to read an answer",negative
I also was forced into downloading the app. I do not like being forced to do anything. I'm still indecisive as to wether im gonna uninstall it.,negative
You shouldn't have forced people to install the app to read the full contents. There are lot of other websites available where we can find information. You just hit your own leg with hammer.,negative
I spend more time on quora then i do on anyother social media platform. It is simply best and anyone who is a curious person like me always finds something of their interest to read on quora,positive
"This is the ever best social media app I have found in my Life. This helped me to grow and change my personality as well. A big thanks to Quora and to all the Quora Writers, because of whose answers I have grown so much. I connect with many people and others also connect to me. Quora must always be there and maintain the same user interface. The blog was good rather than spaces. Spaces is not good. But overall QUORA is the best app.",positive
"I only downloaded the app because the website keeps blocking me from reading questions with a big ""download the app"" message, that once it has appeared I cannot remove. I don't want to be forced into using an app. I just want to read without interruption.",negative
I will not install this app because I don't want to. i am comfortable with reading on web and phone browser. why the hell you are forcing me to download. Just downloaded this app to review it. Uninstalling the app now. This is too damn irritating. How to rate zero star?,negative
Was forced to download. They force us to use app on the website... (I am happy with the content) but highly oppose the tactic of app download indulging,negative
It is very annoying that I have to download an app that I didn't want to just to view some answers. Pretty scummy design,negative
Too many ads and links. If I wanted to see ads and links i can visit other website. Also new feed does not refresh. I have to close and reopen. Life is already a question and you are providing me links??,negative
Awesome experience. On this platform I get answers of each and every question. Best app for all. Students.,positive
I love reading all the questions people ask. It is so very interesting. And to read the answers from professionals & then from someone who is currently going thru it had gone thru the question at hand. Amazing! And I learn stuff along the way. Thank you all for both questions & answers! And thank you Quara for putting them in an article related app!,positive
"Considering the backlash, I'm surprised they still have the surprise blocking window on their website commanding you to use the app instead of their site. Is it because you wish to get rid of the burden of maintaining your mobile friendly Quora site, so you can focus on the app? That's an understandable desire, but the mobile site's limitation appears artificially imposed. Makes me think, why couldn't you just let it be as it was?",negative
A website shouldnt force me to download their app.. I dont like their app and it sends too many useless notifications that i dont need.. To suggest that i download it every now and then is one thing but to have no exit button for this annoying pop up and completely block me from your site without downloading it is completely unacceptable thanks quora for making me realize that now even your website is too much of a hassle to be helpful,negative
Cheap tactics followed by a good platform. Not allowing mobile users to read content on their website. If your app is worth instaliing then you will get the count boss!!!,negative
"I absolutely hate the way they just push you to update or download this app. Like, I have the app but that doesn't mean I can't Google a question on Quora's website. Please just stop. Sometimes i am even using someone else's phone, why force people in downloading they app? Extremely frustrating.",negative
"I written bad review 3 years ago and still feels the same ---- pathetic ""Whenever I try to write answer it fails and most importantly it replaces other words when I use typo. Bdw I love quora but this app making me stop using quora!""",negative
"Interface is getting worse everyday. Notifications are not opening, ask question tab not working. I used to love using this app but not like thisüëé",negative
"I don't understand why I need to download this app in order to read in peace. ""Download this app"" keeps popping on my browser so I had to download it, but don't be so happy because I'm going to give it only 1 star. Fu*k your app.",negative
"Seems okay and runs correctly on my S9? Never heard of it until recently, different questions and answers that put a different spin on things.",neutral
The app itself is functional but the users are nearly missing the point of it. Beautiful heart-wrentching stories are revised to give a one-sentence answer to the posed question. Ive read answers with 10k+ upvotes just to find there wasnt an actual answer to the question and people just like the story,negative
"Better then fb, Google plus!! Just best. Informative and entertaining! I love to go through answers and other people's experiences. This is a great app. Been using this since years!!",positive
I didn't download app But I found out solution for that... Just enable desktop mode. Quora don't force us in fact we r the one because of which your app is running.,neutral
"Nowadays all apps are going to dark mode, here we are Quora is not having that. it's very essential feature and Quora lacks it.",negative
"I'm enjoying answering questions from my domain. It would be great if the admins allowed users to start their own Spaces, after proper scrutiny, that the said user could maintain the Space started by them. Else let the earlier blog option be restarted.",positive
"Quora, I think enough people have pointed out the flaw in your business decision to require users to download the app to continue reading. If you want to let us know there's an app as an option, that's perfectly fine, but don't FORCE it on us. I will never download the app as long as you force it this way.",negative
Broken. Quite often the app just seems to decide it's not going to let you tap any buttons or links anymore until you restart it. Many months later this problem is still not fixed. Now they've also intentionally crippled the website and added a pop-up to force users to install the app.,negative
"Facing issue during the time of reading and when answer is lengthy you have to press read more option lots of time, and some time read more option not open Kindly slove the issue as soon as possible",negative
I would like to read in web browser but it is forcing me to download app. Incredibly inconvenient,negative
"Didn't let me read in chrome, forced me to download the app and now the font size in app can't be changed. So bye bye quora Uninstalling this garbage and Hello to Reddit.",negative
Worst user experience. Always forces me to download the app whenever I use the web version.,negative
"Just downloaded too leave review. Quora was an amazing place too get information. Now you force users too download the app or they can't use your site...a site that works perfectly fine. Ads can be intrusive but unclosable forced ads, so you get your way... are the worst. Done with quora till its gone or like most of us...will be done with quora for good.",negative
"I'm unable to open the answers. I click on them and it is just not opening. And there's no internet issue or lag in my phone. Edit 1 I updated the application, same issue. Uninstalled and reinstalled it, same issue. I've finally uninstalled the application due to the issue. Worst Experience ever.",negative
"Nice app to gather knowledge, but problem is that it crashes again and again on my mobile phone and sometimes it stuck-up in middle when I changes reader mode from English to Hindi. It is the only app which crashes on my mobile. So please fix this problem.",negative
"Overall, I love the concept of this app. People can openly sharing, and giving ideas to everyone.",positive
"It's really cool, kind of hard to use but you get accustomed easily, the answers come in fast, I'm also happy that there are legit professionals that you can get an answer from :))",positive
Was forced into downloading this app just so I could read an article. No option to continue on website. Absolutely no point in doing this.,negative
"Pushing users to download apps is sadistic. But then again I will never install this app, switch to desktop version workaround & encourage others to rate single star & uninstall the app. Thanks for pushing us harder Quora, happy learning.",negative
It says can't get connected to the internet while my connection is 100% strong I can use the web version so why bother use app !!! please fix ASAP,negative
"Read or lose precious work: ""Copy all,"" ""save,"" often. You've been warned. If you prefer mobile input, do this: 1) Place the cursor, 2) backspace once, 3) resume typing. Call it ""code synching."" Different mobile keyboards work very differently because of hidden, wiki text codes. Programmers can't crack it. The mobile app needs significant work to establish some baseline stability. Complaints abound, but problems persist. Use the desktop version when you can. Reread the first line.",negative
This app is quite suitable for answering both practical and theoretical questions about choices in respect of programming languages( and an array of other topics ) with a view of career options. I love this app.,positive
"The experience with the app left a lot to be desired. The web version is so smooth, why cant we just use that instead of this poorly made application. If only we could do that.. The app is so slow ( I play games with good graphics without even the slightest lag ) and at times the pages wont even load properly.",negative
"""Download the app"" or ""I already have the app"" with no option to close the notification. How about NOT removing my choice in the matter? But congratulations, I've been thoroughly convinced to hate Quora for a lifetime.",negative
When it ask if I'm a robot I do the puzzle push the button and nothing happens then it goes back to I have to do it all over again and then it happens again,neutral
I am rating this app one star before opening it because Quota is pissing me off. Can't you be a normal website? First I had to create an account to read more than one article. Now I have to download the mother effing app to see more than one article? Why Quota? Just show me ads or something but none of this micromanagement and control freakism,negative
"It is really informative. You can edit/customize it to things you like/you're curious about. I don't have any problems with it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who is bold and curious about well, anything. Yeah.",positive
"It's surprising that we cannot share a question from this App or they might have a secret menu of which I don't know about. I have to search again and open it in browser to share link which wastes a lot of time. Time does matter for me. Atleast whatever we can do in website, we should able to do in the App. Something so simple is not available and the product is of Google which has this lack.",negative
"App is ok. I'm mad at the mobile website that now literally helicopters you into installing the app to read anything. Every so often the creators make such heavy handed changes - like removing question clarifications - that are clearly what they feel are in their best interests, regardless of what existing users want, and I'm getting tired of it. Update 1/24/20: yet another required app update, app held hostage, off wifi, two stars. If they piss me off further, it will drop again.",negative
"Some phones can only hold so many apps. If the web version of your product forces us to download the app, it really makes no sense. We use the web version precisely because we don't want the app. My phone has no space to hold more apps. I will no longer be using Quora because of this. It is annoying.",negative
"In this app when I open an article up, it would only show first 5 articles, and after that, they take very long time to load When I tap on a blank part of the article where that image is supposed to be, and then I wait about 15 seconds, and the error message will say, ""failed to open image."" When I turn the wi-fi off, all of the articles, including the images will show up. When I have wi-fi on, it would use up alot of memory, not enough for the quora articles, or its images to open",negative
Very average and needs an option to switch off photos. I came to read not necessarily look at images,negative
I would turn five stars for Quora. Luckily for the benefit of querries and their resolutions. But since app is not as easy to explore as other social media it is only for that the query makers would not get at once familiarized with what kind of environment they are being a part of. But as said Quora would altogether make you understand it's real niche. Thanks for me at Quora I have lots to explore mit you.,positive
"This one of the favourite apps in my mobile...I am also a quora blogger...You can get any answer for whatever questions you have, just you should know how to fetch knowledge from googling...But only drawback is that it is not working in desktop version so 4 star",positive
Super slow. I'd rather use my internet app but I cant because I apparently need this app. Still wish the app wasn't necessary to use the site.,negative
"I was typing a brief explanation, and suddenly the app started loading and showed me the Homepage. The update the ruined my quora experience.",negative
"I enjoy answering questions about crossdressing, fantasies, dating, etc BUT I Hate having this app STOP WORKING, asking if I want to leave feedback OR Restart the app!! Can't ANYONE fix this problem??",negative
"The slowest app in the market not gonna lie. I love Quora, I enjoyed it, I got much informations from it, but please optimize your app. My phone isn't that slow to running this app.",positive
"Rather slow to switch between languages, why's that ? I like the apps, but lagging in my flagship device kind of turned me down, y'know ? -_-",negative
Awesome...it helps specialy those people who do not have studious friend group so such students can learn and know about other toppers nd top universities across the country.,positive
"This app is getting worse than i expected. The update version is not working. It was crush, lag, can't be opened. What are the problems? Server? Or what? Please fix that as soon as you can.",negative
‚Ä¢ this application need more optimisation ‚Ä¢ need dark mode ‚Ä¢ offline feature is absolutely important ‚Ä¢ heck... This application can't fill up my smartphone length,negative
Even when the network is good enough it doesn't load properly. The developer (s) sucks üìç. Earlier it was good but after the recent updates the app has stopped working properly.,negative
"The reading source doesn't have dark theme on the app, are you serious? It's hard to read in some conditions, not to mention the disappointment",negative
"Its a very fabulous app. Great for interacting with many of the people who have proper experience of a particular context. But many of the times i face the issue of internet. My internet is worling absolutely well, sometimes it is a bit slow and needs time but whenever i open the app and click on questions, it just says ""Cant connect to the network"" , then it doesnt work no matter how much you try. Almost everytime i face this issue. Please correct it!!!!.Thank you.",positive
Best time pass app. Good answers and it reflect ourselves sometimes. Love to read kinky stuff,positive
"I used Quora few years back, but later uninstalled it. Recently I have installed it again but I'm shocked to see how slow the application is. Really disappointed with the performance of the app. Please do something so that the user has a good experience. Regards, SRIKAR",negative
"Why force me to use the app? I like the mobile browser. If I want to open any related question from the mobile browser, it forces me to use the app instead, which is not the same experience since I can't click back once or twice and get back to Google.",negative
"I am really FRUSTRATED with this app.First it doesn't load all the answers or comments,so i get to ready only one answer and that's it.Second,the ""view more"" function doesn't work neither.I opted to use browser but you keep interrupting me with annoying pop-ups asking me to use the app!!!!!!!!!",negative
I was forced to install this. The official website coersed me into downloading this app while I was surfing. They gave me no option but to install yet another app that I'll rarely use. One star,negative
On 2nd or 3rd page onwords not allow to copy word to know their meaning from google traslater. Earlier which was allowed. For each and every answer when i click on read more it opens new page . Earlier if you click read more then on the same page it used to open Which was more comfirtable.,neutral
"Why don't you allow to read in Browser itself. Every time when I select the option read more, this pop saying there is more in the app , unlock full quora experience.",negative
I dont even care if it is a good App. i just hate that youre forced to install it to continue reading questions which is really annoying,negative
Using on a browser is significantly better. They force you to download this app on mobile so they can have an easier time stealing your data.,negative
I enjoy the many genuine questions& answers on here..some I can relate to & others not so much. But I always think about the answers I cannot relate to. I always see a different point of view that I may or may not have thought of before. Very interesting ppl.,positive
Dear quora please add font size option in app. It's too hard to read small size font.,negative
The website makes me download the app in order to view it on mobile. This is so annoying and unnecessary. No thanks!,negative
"Very interesting app.... I can read other's questions, make my own or maybe simply just learn new things. At the DMV or wherever just WAITING this app gives me something to do, pass the time.",positive
"At first, I didn't like how you had to download the app. However, it literally took 4 seconds for it to download. I was reading faster than I could complain. Instead of writing a 1-star review I kept reading. So if you are having trouble downloading, go ahead and place a 1-star rating. But if not just give it 3-stars and ask for them to give more articles without downloading the app, it's annoying.",negative
"An excellent platform for self education and growth, it teaches what you have not learnt from your school and university. Absolutely amazing.",positive
"I love this app but in this app i am not able to open my notification, despite having good internet connection. They should fix this otherwise this app is awesome.",negative
"Would rate negative for lack of privacy options. Why don't you get it, I simply don't want to install your app and perfectly happy to browse on the phone browser. There is no way for me to remove the popup manually and it is mighty irritating.",negative
"Would've given ZERO stars if that were possible... What a worthless waste of time. Like many others said, I'm super frustrated with quora. Why have a website when you won't even let us use it?!? And if you're gonna force users to use the app, then you either delete the website or improve the app. These developers have done nothing of the two. It's just a complete waste of phone storage and valuable time. Never using this again. Good job losing users, quora.",negative
"Never used the app, never will. I don't need it or want it. The mobile website works great and does all I need it to do. STOP forcing people to download this app. I don't need another unnecessary, pointless app. Just downloaded it to leave this 1 star review before deleting it. (Tip: a workaround to bypass their unclosable ""get the app!"" popups is to check ""request desktop site"" in settings, or just avoid Quora completely and do literally anything else at all.)",negative
Zero stars for not allowing people to use the website on their mobile devices and for forcing them to use this crappy app. These filthy tactics made me completely remove quora from my digital life. There are better alternatives.,negative
I know this is a good app but i am writing this as there is one bug..whenever i tap on view more nothing shows up...i have tried reinstalling the app. Hope u fix it.,negative
"Forced to use an app when the website not only works perfectly fine, it actually performs much better on tablets than this annoying app. For example, unlike on the website, there is no pinch zoom function - this is a major issue for people like myself with low vision. At the same time, the app doesn't work well if you increase your system font size. It's also harder to search, not user-friendly, and has a completely different interface than the main site. There's NO ""better experience"" here",negative

"Very bad site, first forces you to sign in , then download app l, why do I need to download app. When I can browse in the open web.",negative
It's very informative and I am able to learn others perspective and experiences. Often knowledgeable articles. Ofcourse there are those wanna be experts that pretty much clueless. Usually when I have something I'm checking into thats not typical I will get redirected to my usual. Then if I type in search trying to find what I originally tried clicking on to read I am unable and options are for topic but generalized and not quite what I was looking for.,positive
"Quora app has frustrating problems.. Links may not open after you click them, even you may have a good internet connections, and if you click many times then so many pages will open at a time... Browsing experience is poor.",negative
I was reading a good article in chrome and ur stupid reminder popped up to install the app. Even after installing this keep popping up and it never open the same article in the app. Kinda annoying. Pls remive fxxx reminder. And i want to delete my quora account but couldn't find the option to. Ur email keeps coming even if I don't nt want it.,negative
This is a great tool for browsing and getting information on nearly any topic. I think the interface for asking and answering questions could use some tweaking.,positive

You can't use their service unless you download the app. You can't use their service when they release a bugged update. Quota, if you're listening - Apps are not created to replace Web Servicing; they're meant compliment each other. If I wanted to use everyone's website in App version I'd buy 900 Gigabyte phone. But I didn't. Instead dissatisfied and uninstalling. Fix your business model.",negative
Forcing a user to login or signup to check another querry is frustrating. I dont want to login. I am not answering any questions. I am just checking for the answers.,negative

"Ads, sponsors, ads and more sponsors. It's extremely frustrating to scroll and read more answers when every other answer comes with another ad for you to scroll pass. Very user NOT friendly! I just use it on my mobile browser with ad blocker on to not deal with the ads.",negative
From here I can know all the unknown facts my interest in the aviation sector. And my experience with this app is very good because all kinds of questions which I want to ask answers are there already. So I think it is very good app to learn as well learn the unknown things.,positive
"Interface is stupid. Instead of showing all answers to a question, it shows just single one, then somewhere at the bottom hard to notice button. Also hard to tell advertisements versus answer.",negative
The app is great. But if I want to read the content on website I want to read it in website. You can't force me to download the app by blocking tbe page with a message.,neutral
I just love it. It's so much fun reading all the stories plus u get to learn stuff.......,positive

I enjoy answering questions and share my own experience and knowledge. Thanks Quora for giving us opportunity to help others to find better answer and also to make world more knowledgeable. Many people changed their life through Quora I believe. Thanks again üòäüëç!,positive
"I dont know why the quora website on browser and also in app not working properly.Earlier,I or I think many people use it as many times as they want to use it but due to some bugs it is nt giving the appropriate results to anyone.Even in fast net,people are not able to use it efficiently.Its my humble request to the backend team,the developer department please try to solve this bug!!!",negative
"Quora is awesome, no doubt about that, I use it more than Fb or Instagram. But this app, sucks. Notifications won't open, feed won't load. Nothing happens even when I'm having a high speed wifi.

Fake app forces u to download on top of that will crash regularly and drain your battery. Using it on the site itself was much better,negative
Downloaded just to reveiw. Wont let me use the site on my phone without downloading. Not everyone has room on theyre phones. What a selfish buisness practice. From listening to your reveiws it sounds like the app is really bothering people. Browser should be full content,negative
I don't want your stupid app I just wanted to read articles in chrome. But you make it impossible by constantly trying to force me to download the app. So I'll avoid quora in the future. Thank you.,negative
Quora gives a unique experience in form of social interaction that is one of a kind. Its not some flashy app where one posts photos and garners likes and comments. Quora is a place for exchange of thoughts and intellect that connects one another by the sense of knowledge. Its one of the best apps I've ever used.,positive

Quora is a good platform but the only thing is your text box sucks.. It is becoming very difficult to edit the text after typing. And also it is getting hung sometimes,negative
"It forces me to download this app so I can access more content, when using google is perfectly fine. I don't like being forced to do things.",negative
"Update after update, the overall quality of answers are dropping and forced to use this app whenever I scroll through the mobile site. No other reason to use this App. Recommended content is repetitive even after reporting or muting the topics.",negative
"Most ridiculous app for questions and answers ever. The bot that modifies your question removes all relevant information and you cant include context without a link? No, just let me type out the situation while I'm here. Just stupid. Yahoo answers was better than this.",negative
I hate that there's no option to read the second page of quora on web browser. I personally don't like to have an app for everything.,negative
It's run only wifi not with mobile data. But definitely it's great app for knowledge seekers.,positive

App is not perfect. Plz dont show your suggestion about getting app in the web... Also app not working as it before,negative
"Quora is irritating me lately. I Gsearch 4r somthng, Quora appears & I open it. After few secs, quora asks me 2 login in order to view d content. I usually quit.. But if it's necessary, I'll login. And then again after few seconds, quora asks me to download the app & hides content! You are literally forcing & Manipulating me towards downloading ur app! I used to write answers for questions on quora related to comics & music. Not anymore. Just know that you lost someone who used 2 contribute alot",negative
Always crashing. Crashes when I'm in the middle of reading something. And when I reopen it - can't get back to what I was reading before it crashed Fix the crashing bug.,negative

"The app lags a lot, especially when I am typing an answer. By the time I get to my second long paragraph, the letters appearance are delayed. Taps are also delayed by 10 seconds (tapping another sentence). The app will sometimes freeze and crash. When the app freezes, I'd sometimes minimize the app. But there was a bug where the keyboard stays at the bottom part of the phone, but remain unresponsive. I like the UI of the app, though. Very easy to navigate. The delays are the only downside.",negative
"Just a awesome way for me to stay connected to people who are like minded and to hear about others that are able to find there way through this Journey known as life .I am grateful and always fascinated how we are drawn to the people we are and for what reasons ...I am in awwe of how much we are all here for some form of each other's growth,and ultimately to find ourselves ....üë£",positive

Quora is great but pushed me to download the app whenever I click on a link and I didn't like that so I'm giving them 1 star. It's like YouTube and their ads,negative

The Quora app does not work properly on my tablets (w/keyboard) and chromebooks due to it being vertical without the ability to change to horizontal and this renders it useless....,negative
i love to read quora but when internet speed is low it can't display even text. You definitely need a serious optimization on this.,negative
It used to have some serious problems but I lived with it. Now it functions in portrait only. I use my tablet landscape only so I don't read Quora anymore,negative
"Why the f*** did y'all take functionality away from the mobile site and you force people to download this app just to read certain questions? What was the point? I uninstalled it immediately after I read the question and its answers, cause I don't have space on my phone for a pointless app.",negative

"I hope you know that I'm downloading this app only because I have to, since you won't let me use your website. Then I'm deleting the app, and never using your website again. I can assure you that I am not the only person with this reaction. Trying to force people into using your service makes people quit using it. Have a nice day.",negative
Undoubtedly good app. What is terrible about it is the endless and stupid recommendations on home page. There is no way to stop them or change them.,negative
"The concept of this app is alll suuper new to me. I rarely venture outside the boundaries of my regular phone usage, exploring the full potential that having internet at ur fingertips can provide. I just so happened to come accross this app, open it & it intrigued me from jump. I personally have yet to encounter an issue i would consider to be ""an issue"" & in fact, im LOVING this app! I love the concept & love the packaged knowledge at my fingertips! So far, So Good!üòä",positive

I have uninstalled and then installed again 3 times in hope that mayne this time the app will run smoothly but no ! Please find the glitch and work on it for us. Please.",negative
Forcing someone to install the app is just wrong. I prefered reading through website and the pop up blocking the reading is really dissapointing. I installed this app just to give this rating. Please allow us to read how we want,negative
"Good app with ""forums"" or ""spaces"" for almost everything and every interest. Filled with both dumb and intelligent people. You will get joy out of the dumb ones and knowledge from the intelligent ones. I totally recommend this app though!",positive

"App riddled with ads and takes forever to load even a single article. Don't worry, the Ads always show up though..",negative
"App works okay not great really. It ( Quora ) actually forces you to install app, heights :-/ Content : Well I really liked the content from some of the best writers in the past about 5 yeara ago , likes of balaji and all, now well every tom dick and harry becomes a top writer. Horrible attention seeking teens with ""yeayyy 10k upvotes"" status Most of the times content in recent times is just a copy paste of other media or a useless story It had potential but not my cup of tea now",negative
"Whenever I browse quora from chrome, start reading an answer in midway reading a stubborn card appears to download the app which won't leave until you refresh the feed. This is really disgusting and needs improvement.",negative
Currently i am facing some problem while using this app. Even if the network is fine the app loads the content very late.Please solve this issue.,negative

It is a very very good app. It really clears all my questions. You can ask questions to anybody or a particular person.you can answer also.,positive
"Great site to share ones opinions, to rant, educate, to express personal stories and passions. I would rate five stars but nothing or no one is perfect except me! Lol!",positive
I think there is bug. I can not read more than one answer.. So 1 star for the app I might change it if problem is solved... Thank you,negative
"This is such a useless app.. Even if we write a question, it doesnt get uploaded even after submitting it..",negative
"Amazing when it comes to sharing information, extremely irritating when it comes to lagging. Oftentimes, I will press on a post or share and it won't open. My screen is alright and this wasn't happening previously. If it gets addressed, I will return the 5 star rating.",negative
Great app. But one star less due to inavailability of dark theme. Please include that.,positive
"Recently, I re- installed quora app. However, when I tried to login in app, it shows error message saying ""unable to reach server"". But i am able to login in quora website in browser in same machine. Ironically, web version forces you to use app. Please solve this issue which is very annoying.",negative
"The thing is no matter how good one app is people should be allowed to operate it on browser, popping of the app dialogue everytime I open a question is a pain in the ass",negative
"Company is aggressive with downloading the app, even if one just wants to use browser. So many pop-ups",negative
Stop trying to force me to use your app! It doesn't even work as well as the website. Also the limits on question length and format and not allowing further explanations dumb down what can be asked. Quora seems like an excellent idea massively hindered by the supposed improvements of the people running it.,negative

"Not letting me login!!! Says ""Unable to connect to server"" I tried the web version and it works without such an issue. The app won't let me login. I've tried clearing local data, cache etc. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. But AM GETTING THE SAME ERROR!!! ""Unable to connect to server""",negative
It's definitely an informative app; the experience of many of the Quora responders can not be understated.,positive
"Quora is useful but why tf you force to install app. I want to use browser only from mobile, what's the problem with it. Why you block access from mobile browser after opening 2nd page.It's to so annoying. You UX team is worst. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé",negative

"Redirecting from browser to app to read posts doesn't work. The app goes blank, uninstalled",negative
"I love the platform and the idea! You just have to be careful to sort of 'weed out' the people trying to offer honest, intelligent answers versus the people who are just bored surfing and wanting to try and mess with other members or give them a hard time. I really, really do enjoy the app, tho. Thank you, Devs!",positive
"This app is telling me that there is a new version but when I click on the link, it takes me to Google Play and then I click on the update link after which it reports that it's waiting for download but that's as far as it gets. It just loops in the waiting queue. I am also having the same experience when trying to update Facebook so it appears that the problem may be with Google Play. Anyway, it's somewhat frustrating.",negative
"Informative, thought provoking conversations. No matter how arcane your knowledge, it will be useful to someone.",positive
Quora is helpful most of the time but recently it has stopped qoeking and gives the 'Request timed out' error. Please do something about this issue,negative
QUORA gives me opportunity to share some things I have seen in the past that had no solution till I read somewhere in the answers from unexpected normal layman's response. It doesn't always take a professional to solve a problem. It sometimes has an answer in just reading what people went through. It also has some comical pictures that makes your day. I think QUORA is one of the best past times which benefits us in various ways.,positive
The fact that I can't view the website properly without installing the app is a pretty low ball move.,negative
"Reading notifications is a nightmare. Sometimes, there's a ""Next Notification"" button. All good in the hood. But sometimes (most times?) there isn't. So you have to press ""Back' and find where you were in your notifications list, click on the following one, and try again. Repeat 79 times if you've been away for a few days. Why can't the Next Notification button always appear, if there are more notifications?",negative
The App is not smooth. There's always loading. The loading also takes so long. Please fix it. Thanks,negative
"I love the idea of quora, there able to bring some smart people to explain questions, but to often in the quantum physics area you have people that haven't read an artical in a decade or two or have people repeating the question just to make their answer longer to be the first answer people see and drag it out to sometimes not even answer the person's question trying to be quora famious, and the evils of money takes it's toll on potentially a 5 star app favoring traffic over spreading knowledge",neutral
Its very nice to learn more in life. The authors of the articles are like treasures of knowledge.,positive
"The questions are mixed. I didn't know that cretin space aliens could come from about three Universes over just to insult us with animalistic scratchings on a website. Otherwise, stellar reference mindsets are there shoring up gaps and omissions in the cosmic mindskew. Credentials are superb and council reference is nowhere in sight. I LIKE IT!...",negative

"I love using Quora but why do I need to download the app to use it? Why can I not just use it through my mobile browser? Instead I get a pop up while reading to download the app, and then can't continue using Quora. Do you really want to disable me from using your brand, just because you want me to download your app? Annoying.",negative
"Bring back the ability to read in landscape rather than portrait all the time. Also, still crashes pretty regularly.",negative
"Right, about 2-3 years ago, the app was smooth, elegant and quick. Since then, every update has only worsened it, be it the confusing new upvote button or the slow-loading embedded web pages. Today it looks kinda like a cached website and even the answers take an eternity to load. Why!? My connection is great and my phone has tonnes for memory so please don't suggest checking that. Stop making crappy changes that slow everything down. So frustrating!!",negative
"When I tap on a question, it doesn't open up right away. It takes a while, and opens up the previous story or the next one. I have to tap multiple times and wait and wait for the answer to open up. This has become increasingly annoying. I had to edit my review just to point this out. Not okay.",negative
"App crashing frequently. While reading next answer, previous answer is being shown. Answers take too much time time to load. An app is supposed to make things easier. What are you doing quora? Are you even talking to your developer team. The app is gettibg worse day by day. It is time to delete quora.",negative
"This app is very helpful for me.When some questions arises in my mind then first app which comes in my mind is ""quora app"".Requesting answers for a question is also very good feature.Due to this feature, i get answers of my questions very quickly.I love this feature.I love quora app.",positive
Something seems terribly wrong when trying to switch from Quora Hindi to English and vice-versa after the latest update. Please get it rectified.,negative

"Downloaded this app just for this. Sent them an email, but once I realized I couldnt leave a review here without downloading, it's pretty much final for me. Im done using quora and never will again. A company that first forces you to make an account to switch article to article. Then they force you to download the app or else you cant go article to article. No thanks.

It is the best platform to express yourself and your knowlege and ofcourse to gain lots of knowledge. I just love it.,positive

Everytime I try to go back to correct a word or sentence, it takes forever to get the curser to go where I want it to go. Like it pauses or something. It is soo annoying. It's not my internet or data, it's the only app that has this issue. As I'm typing right now there is no glitchy curser, everything is smooth. Please fix this issue, it's the only thing keeping me from giving yall a 5 star",negative
"One star, simply because Quora forces you to install the app instead of continuing to read what would be a fully functioning site in the mobile browser. The most annoying thing is that behind the overlay forcing you to go to app install, you can see their former skippable prompt. Screw you Quora!",negative
I give you 4 stars for the good quality information you give. But sometimes when I click continue reading it goes back to the begining and its annoyying.,negative

Great app for my phone.",positive
This is a wonderful platform that I can learn something. it's better than Other social media applications. Thank you so much,positive

"My experience on Quora has been extraordinary. The app has had few problems and rarely crashes. i discovered quora at one of the lowest points in my life. Even with life experience and more than three yesrs of college, no job. I was homeless and depressed. I began to answer questions about homelessness, and soon expanded my topics. In 2018 I was named a Top Writer, and just a few days ago invited to join their Partners Program, where one receives monetary incentives. Quora is ALL THAT, and more.",positive
"This app really gives you a wide perspective in life. Even the most narrow minded, naive bunch of our society will start being broader in sense.

"The bookmar bar is not easy to find and also the user interface is confusing as well. This app also in serious need of night mode, like how do you think someone will use bleaching white of this app at night without burning their eye sockets. Your own website is comparatively better.

The notifs filter didn't even work! And it's too laggy, compared to using Quora on a mobile browser. You guys can't fix the app, yet still force the people using the mobile browser into your app?? I'm sorry for being so rude but I've always delayed reviewing this app IN HOPES that it'll improve. BUT IT GOT WORSE!",negative

"This app is wonderful, as well as awful as it doesn't refresh up content fast. Its damn slow and it keeps reloading the same page and ask me to check my net connection even though I use it on wifi which has a great speed. I am tired of waiting for it to refresh the content. I uninstalled it and later reinstalled it too but it was still same. I want to read out many contents but I cannot do so.",negative

"Didn't want app, was secretly signed up. I somehow signed up for this app, yet didn't know I had until I got a security update. I have no idea where or how I got it. It seems to be a VERY, VERY, simple, and degrading form of Facebook, the first thing a read was about a lady, and I use that term lightly, whose ""retarted boyfriend"" put a tampon in her bottom.......really, I need to read stuff like this. Very poor app and secret signup process. I suggest immediately deleting your ""account"".",negative
"Day to day problem ,common dificulties are posted here. Many reader ,after going through those problems,they share/express their their's opinion/experience ,which might be solve the problem of others.",neutral
The concept is great. The app not so much. A lot of lag and bugs. Also the moderators are more concerned with cuss words than pedophile predators. I think that's a strange way to prioritize.,negative
Very good app for getting knowledge world widely and also critics. It can be read easily and interestingly.,positive
"I love the app,but now i can't go to the section where my notifications suggest me to go. If i press on the notification it will bring me to a page where it says ""didn't found an internet connection""",negative
Appalling to have to download the app and be completely unable to browse the site on your mobile Web browser. Pathetic,negative
From last 2 updates your app has become pathetic.. My internet is working good in other apps but when it comes to your it sucks. Its a request to please fix these issues it takes so much time for every single command otherwise i have to delete QUORA.,negative
Forcing to use app is not a good way to promote your product. I found an alternative way to read anyways.,negative
"Got blocked for not using my full name, they could have given me the option to change it before making a decision, that they apparently aren't too concerned with revoking long after I mended the situation",negative
"Its no longer usable in browser coz a window will pop up to download it and you can't remove it ,i forced to download it",negative
"On tapping on Submit answer, no response. Even draft is not being saved. Update immediately.",negative
"Gets stuck all the time, specialy during text input. Please work on the interface.",negative
The app is well-built over all. It's great to be able to share Thoughts with random people.,positive
I have been using it for long ago since 2017 and it has been a wonderful experience. Those moments I spent on readin quora has taught me something to better myself. It a great platform for learning. It's much better than Instagram fb and others.,positive
"I love Quora, super interesting and unique platform. The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is the impact of the constant interruptive advertising in the feed amongst the real content. It really ruins the experience for the user. I'd gladly pay for an ad-free version of the app.",positive
You guys really need to work on this app. It has information but it really doesn't load stuffs and you can't even answer questions. I mean it is really awful.,negative
"A very helpful app, things are very simple and understandable. Wish you happy answering & questioning.",positive
The app was working good before February...But Now it sucks....It is showing Timeout for every search...,negative
"Forced to download, so here's how you workaround this a**hole design: top right of chrome browser > tick Desktop Site > refresh page You're welcome. The app itself is no different from the site so I don't see the point in forcing it on people lol.",negative
This app is running too slow. Day by day its getting worst in loading pages. It's slowness making user to leave the app.,negative
"This app is the arguably the best app if you need a question answered, and the good part is that you won't get judged on your questions. Everyone here is a friend to each other and not only that, you can also answer other people's questions too.",positive
"It is a WONDERFUL app.... I enjoy using this application. Bt I dont know it is a bit slow these days... Quite slow... Nd is the only reason I rated 4 stars , otherwise it would definitely be 5.",positive
I'll give it one star actually 'cause it always pops up to download an app which i do not think is necessary and the informations i get is not all relevant.,negative
"This app is very useful ,but my ""view more ""tab is not working I can only view a limited answers. What could be the problem.",negative
"Please, give its previous font. Literally, nobody is happy with this font. 2 star for this updated font.",negative
"Never thought I'd get this connected to a social media app üòÆ This app is just great for getting to know new people, asking and answering question about anything, really, and being a part of communities. Totally suggest you download and try it for yourself :). üå∑üå∑üå∑üå∑üå∑üå∑üå∑ Only problem I have with the app (The computer website works great!!) is that photos on here sometimes don't load. Might be my phone model, since my brother tells me it works alright for him, and we have different phones. :)",positive
"Not only did I have to create an account to view certain posts, but once I did it forced me to download the app anyway, I just wanted to see the answer to one question that's all! Very annoying.",negative
"I love this app. Every morning or before I go to sleep, this is the app I open because I enjoy reading different people's ideas and opinions and I learned new things everyday. Great app for learning and entertainment at the same time. üòÄ",positive

Amazing application .. I get lots of knowledge and experience of people and even I get to share my experience .. Thank you Quota üç∞,positive
"I am not giving these ratings for content, but for the app, the app loads the text part fast but the image part is like never loading, even when i am connected to a good network speed. The app fails to load the images.",negative
Slow!! The only problem with this app is it takes a lot of time to refresh although there is a strong network connection and hence frustrates me every single time i tries to reload the feed page.,negative
"I'm very disappointed in this app. Originally, I was using the website to browse and answer questions. Then it became apparent that it was impossible to even scroll through my feed without the banner telling me to download the app, so I did. Even now, it tells me I'm not using the app, it deletes every answer I type and cant open links to my browser. The screen regularly goes blank (white with an x) too. Very unpleasant experience so far.",negative
Terrible app.. though content is awesome.. the app functioning is like hell! So difficult just to add. Single question!!! Frustrating!,negative
This is the greatest app ever! And me being a teenager and you know we have a lot of questions... It makes it much easier,positive
App is very unstable offlate. It doesnt provide latest feed. It takes long time time to get refreshed feed.,negative
"It's really good app, i have ever came across. It is really helful, be it regarding education Or life lessons Or people advice, experience, tips. Bt the problem is with people, who are writing there sexual fantasies, fake stories, n inappropriate pictures, such people should be blocked.",positive
App not working properly. Unable to load even home page. Continuously loading home page!!! Even if internet is working showing can not connect.,negative
Quora has articals that are very interesting but then some of the other articals are just a waste of time,negative
It's a Wonderful app and i appreciate it. But it tooks many time for downloding the app. A part of this. Is a good one,positive
"Quora is a valuable forum to express your feelings, clear your doubts, find many opinions as a seekers and at the same time it is a knowledge sharing, experience sharing experience for the writers who answer the questions. It is a win, win and win situation for both. And third win for the other readers who may get benefitted by just coming across a question. Good luck to all.",positive
"Is there an option to give zero stars? Why you ask? Well it doesn't even let me login. I select the ""continue using Facebook or Google button"" and then it seems to load but it doesn't and it stays on that page.",negative
sucking Quora can't read even single page in Browser You are pushing to download the app.Are you thought Reading single article need your app. Do You know one thing Google allows browse anything with it's Wesite. Surely i will uninstall that aftr reading the article.,negative
It's ok. Interesting app but it's very poorly designed. Constant crashes and freezes. Poorly designed UI. Everything is too bright. Sometimes you'll click certain answers and it'll pull up something else entirely. This app needs a lot of work.,negative
Very unstable when editing. Clumsy interface.. no dark mode. Bad control placing for hiding questions,negative
"Unable to launch Quora on my new phone - Panasonic P55 Max. It has got something to do with Google Smart Lock. Despite switching off google smart lock, the problem persists. Unable to login via google or facebook account or even by way of sign in or sign up. In my old phone, I did not face any such issue.",negative
At first this app was very brilliant.. it showd all ansrs for my questions.. but now i feel like it lost its charm.. u wil get only single ansrs for ur question.. and it is very slow now.. take lots of time to load.. to log in.. i'm hating it,negative
It is ok even though i just get more questions and not much reciprocating responses. I uninstalled the app. I found it to be too compacted. Thanks!,neutral
I can't sign up at all. I tried re installing it but it doesn't work. I even tried making an account in chrome but everything was in vain,negative
"I get so much help from everyone's input. Helping me to continue and try to clearly understand what has been done to me. Slowly. From 7yrs of age. To- I'm now the age of 41.

You guys forcefully make us download the app while we just want to use it from google chrome. This is disappointing.,negative
Its really amazing all of the things you can learn from other people on certain topics and use them in your daily life..,positive
Please add split screen support for the app in oneplus . Otherwise app is perfect.,positive
It's a very good app for gaining knowledge and information about various topics around the world. But the app sometimes take time to respond. So please fix it. Overall I love this app.,positive
"Lovely contents and helpful blogs to read and know about. Everything is just exceptional and some blogs are educative, informative and insightful.",positive
"All is good, only problem is taking too much time to fetch data or Display on phone.. server is too slow.. Even Netflix Served Content fast than your text Content.",negative
"Hi,I would like to say this app was really great we can know about anything especially about words/phrases n society in here. but the one thing that terrible is the connection. I've used connection in indonesia and it's completely disaster when it come I use this app, despite everything was fine , please fix it. I'd always happy use this app if ur connection in Asia has fixed n problemless, n mine is 4G. due for the commercial user maybe someone had a problems like mine too. Thanks in advance.",negative
Great app. There are a few buggy issues when trying to view your notifications but overall it works great with my Note 10+ 5G.,positive
"Taking away the option to view a question on website to increase your app downloads is retarded. Myntra did it, regretted it. Quit this scheme or you will too",negative
"That banner suggesting to download your app is outrageous, there is no way to cancel it or remove it and it covers nearly whole page .... I don't want your funking app just put a little cross to remove that banner üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†",negative
The standalone android application is way too annoying. Unable to login server error,negative
Please bring dark mode to app. It saves battery on AMOLED display. It's easier on eyes.,positive
This thing won't load. It only show me like 5 to 10 articles and then it always say connection error even if the connect is perfectly fine.,negative
"Such an underrated app!! Even when Instagram and TikTok is ruling today's world with all the photos and videos, we can see that there are still people who like to read and write!!",positive
"Its a very great app to learns things. Quora developers should also include Dark mode,it would be great improvement.",positive
"I was urgently looking for an answer, what to do when pack of stray dogs attack you. Couldn't see answers because I did't have the app. Then I had to log in.. then it wouldn't connect to facebook!!! Not ok!",negative
Love this app. You never stop learning new information and if you have a question about life in general or a certain subject there is always somebody older and wiser that is able to give you their take on the subject your enquiring about. People up vote your comments and seem to be extremely helpful and knowledgeable.,positive
I hate this app. Why in my right mind would I want to use this app for my questions rather than just use the website. It is irritating that I cant just use the website and it asks me to install the app and login with google or facebook every time i click on something,negative
Forcing your users to download your useless app is a sign of weakness and lack of self esteem. Imagine if every website we visit started forcing the internet user to download their app then our phone memory will be gone in days.,negative
customer service. rules and politics are somehow different from any other social networks and are pretty unpredictable. watch out for the rules before you start to participate. cause the idea is very attractive and answers. sometimes. are very interesting and deeply informative,positive
The app is really cringy. It is full of bugs and lagging terribly :( Really dissapointed. Expected a better product from Angelo.,negative
Really a good initiative in regional language. Just winder how many people put efforts to answe my question. Simply great..,positive
I did not want to download this app to get the answer to my question. Your emails are boring and annoying and i dislike the questions that you send me asking me to answer or look at. This is nonsense. You're like pinterest in how annoying accessing you is. Stop.,negative
"Why are you guys forcing us to use the app? The quora site suddenly displays ""open in app"" and then get redirected here after clicking.",negative
Pushes you to install the app even when I don't have space and would have been fine using the site on a browser. Very bad experience.,negative
I don't understand why i am not able to sign in. After trying many times i was able to sign in once... But again i was logged out. And the same problem repeated.,negative
Sure its great but it asked me what languages I understand and then gave me the app in Spanish. That was not on my list. Uninstalled.,negative
Don't force in chrome to open in app... App sucks and full of bugs... Multiple issues and not at all good,negative
"At one time it was a very good platform. It was not only informative, but theraputic. Unfortunately, it has taken a turn for the worse. Security is not an issue with them. They demand full disclosure of your personal info or you can't participate. Others have been threatened and stalked, they don't care. They use ""bots"" to review & regulate posts and the bots are not accurate AT ALL! You will no doubt be blocked at one point or another, to which there is no resolution. I'm hitting delete!",negative
Maybe make a separate notification tab for questions and answers. But overall experience is pretty good.,positive
"Downloaded just to say DON'T FORCE ME TO USE YOUR APP. I simply wanted to use your website. From my mobile browser and get a stupid pop up that won't go away. If I choose to use my browser over your stupid app, let me.",negative
This latest update has made this app so irresponsive. Hangs each time when writing any answer. This is so frustrating!,negative
"Quora is a very limited platform, there are a number of issues with moderators silencing people who offer views that they do not support, sadly this is mostly politically aligned. It is not an open platform that totally supports free speach and dissidents of a particular party will often have their posts removed or deleted. However, the functionality of the app is pretty good. While the app itself works just fine, I would NOT recommend using Quora at all. Thats why the app only gets 2 stars.",negative
It forces to download this app to look at other posts even though I was already logged in. Probably to track what I am browsing more. Very close to scam business if not it.,negative
The app is inefficient and incomplete in many ways. Ultimately we read from quora so try to improve user's reading experience. And one more thing don't force the user to use the app they should feel it naturally.,negative
"I have been on Quora for more than 3 years. For more than a year this app was great. Then after an update my experience with it has been a buggy nightmare. Regardless of whether or not use my phone or tablet commenting and even answering is fine for a moment and then glitches occur freezing the screen, misplacing the cursor, freezing my keyboard and ultimately crashing Quora and at times my phone. As mentioned my tablet and phone are both affected. It's ruining my Quora experience.",negative
"This is a good forum to exchange your thoughts, seek answers and gain perspective. However, we find people misusing the features in many ways. It needs to be governed well for the bonafide use.",neutral
Unfortunately this app is a big question! This app's settings is third class It's not working properly on 4g network! And biggest thing is that this website working in browser funtastic but when you going into Quora application this is only hanging and hanging and hanging and hanging and hanging! My suggestion to the developer that your first duty is make a question less application and then you try something else,negative
"Let me tell you this, I am stuck in the middle of nowhere and I got 1 mb data left in my phone and instead of ordering a cab , I chose to install and give this app 1 star rating. That is how much I hate your moderation team.",negative
"Mobile website is better than the app, so stop pestering me to use the app. App has no dark mode, it's less responsive & more buggy. But usable.",negative
"Useless, it seems to be just a thin client. It's less comfortable to use than the website. If it worked offline that would make it worth having. It also doesn't respect the device orientation.",negative
"Fun place when you're bored to read deeper into the human mind, ask questions, answer questions, and read stories. Or if you're curious about anything, I'm sure someone wrote about it!",positive
"Too much nonsense in here, but there's some vital information too. It would be better if it can be channeled to individuals taste.",neutral
"Pretty good for checking my notifications and reading other answers. However, half the time I write an answer, the app ends up buffering out.",neutral
"Hi Quora dev, I really love your work. But somehow this app can't run flawlessly on my android (nougat) device, when I open it the quora aplication just show bottom navigation menu and white loading screen, can yau help me (and maybe other people with same problem) fix this? Thanks. Once again, I really love your work, and I hope someday I can work with y'all.",negative
"I love, love Quora! It is my go to app everytime. I highly recommend it to everyone, which I have already to two of my friends. They too have become so into Quora, I'd swear their addicted! Yeah, probably me too! That is how amazing Quora is. Thanks",positive
"Very much buggy and irresponsive app, not letting me post an answer, not letting me to view more than one answer of a question (view more option doesn't work at all.) Never download this app, I will suggest you use the web app form chrome, go to the site and click ""Add to Home Screen"" on menu.",negative
Can't even open the damn thing! I've been to open the app but it says cant connect to the internet. I've tried uninstalling it too. Doesn't work.,negative
"Idiotic website, forces to download app, not allowing user to continue reading on the browser. Why should I be forced. I should be able to make a choice if I want the app or not. Rather the website stops working and forces with a pop-up to download the app.",negative
Great website but if you want your phone to stop working go ahead and install the app. The thing is very very veeerrrryy buugggy.,negative
Where is the description of what was changed in the recent update? I don't update apps without knowing what was changed.,neutral
Perfect to master new language while learning interesting things and general knowledge.,positive
I love quora But since few weeks it has crashed I m not able to send msg to anyone nor i m able to cmnt on any answer Morever i m not able to login from chrome also.. I hv tried reinstalling it..but all in vain Pls help me out,negative
I've used this app for only the past 2 days and I'm impressed. It really is useful for finding answers for a variety of queries. I feel it is better than other social media apps as Quora has completely knowledgeable info. Kudos to the team which started and is running this app.,positive
Really very good application helps community to grow knowledgeably. But little more need to become an knowledge hub. Thanks,positive
"I am unable to login for past 3 weeks for no reason at all with the pop up saying ""unable to connect to server"" even though tried on different devices. Had sent the mail to quora help email id mentioned, no response from them as well. I have loved quora for a long time now, do not understand what's happening now.",negative
"This will provide good impact in life , excellent application for students. It will help that how to increase your knowledge in which you intrested. Excellent application to gain knowledge, It's really amazing application. It clears all my doubts according to my education carrier. It will helpfull Thanku",positive
"I hate it. I wish more platform like this should be available, and I won't have to use it. They always force to download the app even if you are not a regular user, but just want to check about something. Then after one search, a non removable pop up appears asking to download the app",negative
"There are some people whose vision is low and needs zoom in & zoom out, and there are some people who are interested to read in night No night mode..please modify",neutral
"It is the perfect app for anybody curious and people who want to expand their world view. The joy of learning from experiences of people from a different world, upbringing and/or circumstances cannot be expressed in words. It feels like a community, a family of sorts.",positive
"There must be a search option in bookmarked answers,it saves a lot of time to find the answer",neutral
"An awesome app fill of endless subjects, questions and answers from all colors, ages, sexes, countries etc. Never bored with this app.",positive
"It's a great place to learn from other people, novices and professionals alike. Everyone brings a different degree of understanding and insightfulness based on their own experiences and expertise. I am glad that I can also do the same for the other members. Awesome !",positive
Quora is great site but the contents on application loads slower. Images take time to appear.,neutral
"How to open questions in new tabs like in browser? Why I cannot select and copy text? I want to copy some answers to translate them with Google Translate, because my English is not very good.",negative
Disgusting experience. Does not stop question request notifications despite changing in settings.,negative
All reading apps have night mode of reading except Quora. this is a big drawback of quora.We all need dark mode for eye protection.,negative
"It has changed my language from English to French. I once indicated that I speak French and might like to read some posts in French. I NEVER indicated that I would like to read everything in French. But it has changed the language, and I can't change it back. I can't use the search function either. It's a complete nuisance.",negative
I get things off my chest sometimes. I forgot about mentioning a certain product being advertised that is driving me crazy after the fat shaming post. I hate that they are advertising to pull it all in in a body slimming garment and it is always a woman. I don't approve of the idea of false advertising by hiding our body like that is really good for you. Might be good for everybody else that has issues with fat people but save your money and save a dog. You now have a built in excercise buddy,negative
"There is only one thing wrong here, and it is called the Quora Partner Program. People post stupid, easily google-able questions trying to make money. Its basically paid spam. But other than that, the app works great, and I have a good time with it. Hey Quora, you need to start paying EXPERTS to ANSWER QUESTIONS instead of paying SPAMMERS to ask clickbait garbage.",negative
Excellent reading on so many interesting topics- great answers to so many questions! Very glad that its free too- I've learned so much life-changing info about important health topics for me that I wouldn't have perhaps ever learned had the app not been free.,positive
"Excellent range of topics intelligently answered, but quality suffers from too many moron-level questions that are best answered by a Google query.",negative
"I rated it 5 stars first but I don‚Äôt even know why I can't access to it now. Every time I try, it shows google smart lock or something that prevents me from log into it.",negative
I'm giving 1 star for the simple reason that you made me download the app and I couldn't access content without it.,neutral
App doesnot work. Feed is always empty. Even though website works fine we are forced to use app,negative
Best app to meet people and understand the world.You can increase your knowledge and enhance your ability in writing and reading English language. There are thousands of writers and millions of ideas.A nice app to discuss great issues.,positive
I had so much of thrust for writing from my younger age. This Quora has given so much of opportunities for expressing my views and experiences. Also I read so many people's real time experiences. It all enriches my thinking ability. I recommend this app be used by as many.,positive
Excellent app to pass your time. But my feed has more ads and questions than answers since jan 2018 update.,negative
No option to log out from app if you linked with Google account. Mandatory to select the topics even you want to log out. Frustrating experience to use the app.!,negative
"What? I literally JUST installed this app ten minutes ago.. It already needs an update? That is not looking promising.... I will update it once but if it needs another update shortly after, I will change my review to one star and uninstall this",negative
I hate using your App. Sometimes I can't find my bookmarked answers in bookmarked section and it takes hell lot of time to load my bookmark answers.,negative

Very bad experience with this app!!! Everytime automatically close and hanging out...!!! Please fix this problem ASAP..!!!,negative
It just makes so much errors about language and sometimes turns the screen into black and unreadable i wonder if thats just for me?!,negative
Very bad app. Everytime I want to read a story it doesn't open to the full.,negative
EXTREMELY displeasing of you to FORCE me to use the app instead of the web version on my phone. maybe im more comfortable with the web version. the android app has connectivity and government cencorship issues in iran. please dont force it,negative
"While there's plenty of garbage (i.e. bots), if you find and follow people with similar interests, it's worlds better. I've read a lot of interesting Quora answers and answered a few myself.",positive
You will be in it for hours once u go to read one thing. Also you get an answer for pretty much everything you ask no matter how obscure you think it is.,neutral
The app is too slow to open or load the contens nowadays. It never happened before and yes I cleared the data and cache and is still the same,negative
i hate this app with a passion. it's jumpy as hell. And when i try to access it on the web it won't shut up about its app. i wouldnt care if that were all but the pop ups restricts us from viewing the page. im gonna start using yahoo answers now,negative
"This is really the coolest most intelegent app ive ever come upon. I could give up face book/ messanger, Hangouts, Mewe, Pinterest even too if need be but as long as i can keep being involved w/this place !!!",positive
"The editor is so buggy that it is unusable. Just trying to move the cursor will often cause it to freeze for several minutes and make the phone get hot. This will happen several times even in the course of writing a couple of short paragraphs. Also, if you enable italics, it is impossible to disable them again. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but that has made no difference.",negative
"Lots of bizarre, clearly fictional, and downright disgusting questions and answers. Beware that you will read terrible things, but if you sort through it all there are occasionally well written and interesting tidbits. Not the worst time waster.",negative
I just wanted to read online and it makes you download the ducking app to read any more. I don't want to download the bloody app. Obviously im happy reading online,negative
"Considering most people will get to read questions at the end of the day, it's amazing it doesn't have dark mode, but instead the interface is completely white, everywhere.",neutral
In completely enjoying it u get real person answers and not some rigid cold response and its interactive sonur answers ir responses are seen and some posted I like this app,positive
The app doesn't do anything when I press view more. As a result I am only abld to see two or three entry at any given page.,negative
"How? Just how can someone design a app this bad. Always blocked or not able to connect to server, never seen such a rubish application on Play Store.",negative
Good repository of wisdom. Genuinely a better tool for getting knowledge than Google sometimes. Sometimes.,positive
"This app is pathetic. The mobile answer writing feature is COMPLETELY broken (I have had multiple walls of text ruined, because the app scrambles it when you use italics and bolding). Now I can't appeal a moderation decision. I get a blank screen. That and about 50,000 other bugs since I first installed the app. Quora is a great site but lately it has been getting much worse. If the owners have the same standards for the app as the rest of the site I am afraid they will soon go out of business",negative
"No dark mode? Seriously? Why would they essentially force this app on you if they don't even have the decency to have a dark mode? Make a dark mode,with a proper AMOLED black, and I'll re-rate.",negative
A great format for every question that has crossed your mind. Subjective and objective Informative observations from both professionals and ordinary people alike. Diverse groups to learn and share inormation.,positive
"I love that answers come from such a broad swath of people. Age, sex, geographical location: there's such a variety, and it's the world in a microcosm.",positive
I just want to browse quora sometimes as I'm not a frequent user. But Everytime I click a link it prompts me to open the app. No I don't want the app. I just want to browse in web version. I have already logged in. Worst comes to worst I'll delete my account if this keeps happening,negative
The website version is great i dont mind the app but after an hour it begins to glitch and freeze,positive
"worst app i have ever seen. such a rich and famous company you are, but your app doesnt even work properly! glitches everywhere!",negative
"Overall a great app, i use it more than any other app on my phone. Its an awesome source for knowledge on all topics...I would give it a 5 star rating if you implement Dark mode in the next update :)",positive
"I often find a great deal of information about a variety of subjects ,often so well thought out that there is no reason to add additional comments, excellent work!.üòä What can I say? I appreciate all the feedback that I can get from the wealth of information about any subject .There are so many questions and answers in this fast evolving world that I personally think that 'we' will never catch up with. Every iota of knowledge is very precious. We can only imagine what lies in the future.",positive
Excellent site for mostly intelligent and meaningful sharing of information and ideas. Very low trolling compared to other sites.,positive
"Slower app, not responding several times. Even internet speed is better app fails to open natification pages, stories, profiles. This force me to go on a desktop istead of using app.",negative
Topics are nice and there are various spaces to use. You can gain a lot of knowledge using it. But main problem is that it takes time to load the things making it feel a bit laggy more often than not.

A wonderful App..whatever maybe your question you find it here.. A dark theme for background and probably horizontal screen would do much better.. Otherwise a wonderful app,positive
"I love this quora website (if you only use latest Samsung browser with dark mode) it's have dark mode I uninstalled the app it's useless with out dark mode, I mean mostly apps get dark mode but quora doesn't why??. Even most android os get dark mode but why this app not you disappointed me quora üòîüòî",negative
Need to have dark mode for better reading & browsing. All the apps now are supporting dark modes. But don't know why Quora is so reluctant to introduce dark mode to its app. Have being sending feedbacks for the same. But the issues is still not resolved. Get the dark mode to This app at the earliest.,negative
"As much as I use Quora, and love helping others... the app for Android HAS waaaaay to many ""sticky key,"" issues! So many times it has taken me 30 - 60 minutes to send 1 reply or answer (250 words, usually less!) due to the CONSTANT freezing and locking up of my app & even phone! I'll be using the website from now on or downloading it on my iPad which I have NEVER had an issue using online on there! I uninstalled when my phone just froze to the point it said NO SIM and wouldn't restart!",negative
"Absolutely love it. Such an amazing platform for learning, connecting and sharing information ‚ô•Ô∏è",positive

"During writing a post, in some undesirable conditions it should autosave data. But right now this feature is not available. Otherwise it's best place to interact with people and become good writer.",negative
The app is very very slow . But the content in it is awesome. I want the application developers and the whole Quora team to find a solution for this problem or else soon they will loose their public attraction.,negative
They keep sending emails to closed profiles that have unsubscribed from email services to log in again and generate a new account. This is annoying but it's the only way to keep people visiting this irrelevant outdated website.,negative
"This app is politically biased and NOT for diversity of opinion. The app itself is a good concept, but the way it is moderated is garbage and totally unbalanced.",negative
This is the worst update i have come use The app just freezes frequently am often forced to use chrome I wouldn't mind rolling back to the previous version of this app that works perfectly p,negative
"Not a fan. I get the concept and at first it seemed sort of neat, but confusing for a newbie. And i do not particularly care for the way that youre constantly being notified that you have questions that need to be answered. It started to feel more like a job than something that was fun or relaxing",negative
"Very slow when typing. It gets more frustating the longer you use the app. Errors frequently, especially when I changed between apps. The PC version is a lot better.",negative
Too slow and unoptimized starting from the last update. It takes 5-10 seconds for a page to load and every time you press a button you have to wait 3 seconds for the press to register,negative
"you barely have enough space to write a question, yet everyone who answers is always very nitpicky with how you word it. you cant delete your own questions most of the time. everyone seems to be slanted towards one type of mindset, unless you post in a ""space"", which will have an additional set of rules. for some reason, you HAVE to use your real name, or make up a very real-sounding fake one.",negative
Quora is an absolutely brilliant App i love it I believe it answers realistic questions without missing words.And with no apoligies.,positive
"It keeps freezing, going onto different questions when i click on it, wont open questions im interested in whats wrong with it the past few weeks?so frustrating!",negative

"I absolutely love Quora, but the app just sucks!! It's so glitchy and crashes approximately after a half hour after I've started browsing, for no reason at all. It's also very slow despite me having a strong internet connection.",negative
interface is not good. People posting anonymously irrelevant content. consumes a lot of data but still dont load images. some good answers are very helpful. Images loading and disappearing .,negative
Every time I open quora in browser it says quora app is better please download and never lets me browse even though I logged in to quora using my mail id. The quora app popup in browser cannot be closed. That's really annoying.,negative
Its a great app but recently it is having problems in loading content. Most of the time it is showing error 505. Plz fix this.,negative
"Forced to use app. The app isn't good as website. Keep crashing and doesn't open correctly when I clicked on result on Google, the app shows homepage instead.",negative
I like this app very much and I think it would be a great idea to have a different language translation for other topics.,positive
"This is a greatest Q&A platform I have ever used. There are many experts that are willing to help others. You'll get answers to any question really fast. Although the site is very good, the app is very buggy and sometimes go crazy. And also, I hate being forced to download the app instead of browsing online. However, I reccomend everyone to try this app! Thanks the developers.",positive
Soooooooooooo many notifications. *in a mocking voice Oooooo look at this We think you would like this This looks interesting It is so god damn annoying and it made my phone sound like a sex toy,negative
"I can't use your contact form because it keeps saying ""can't connect to the internet"" as I am filling it!!!! I can't appeal the moderator decision because of this! How can you release such a buggy app out in the market?",negative
Full of bugs. 1) When I click on an answer sometimes other answer pops up. 2) Fails to view images many times.,negative
Its slow and freezes for a few seconds when I click on read more on a brand new phone when every other app is super responsive. You need to hire better software engineers.,negative
"Useful, informative and somewhat entertaining at times. I have asked serious questions and have gotten good, honest and some professional answers, but on the same note, have also read instances where peaple were being made fun of or laughed at in situations. The app does freeze alot and sometimes moves very slowly but it is one of my fave forums or platforms for peaple to share experiences or ask questions.",positive
"There are many interesting topics. Once i replied to bipolar, because i am, thats the only thing i receive to read.",positive
Can not open the app. Showing no internet connection. Several times i met the problem. Whats the solution?,negative
please implement some UI changes and please add dark mode option it would be just great if these features are added.,positive
New update and UI lag on my phone. It seem as running Android emulator on 2gb ram pc. üòë Web version is more stable that android app.,negative
"Wish I never signed up. It was a mistake to share my main email with this app. It's flooded with useless notifications, and I have to direct them all to spam. One notification is enough. I was also upset to find that you had to share your real name. It feels draining of any privacy. I don't think it's worth it.",negative
"Great app.. but most of time this app is freaking slow when load the articles, images and even the home page.. I hope you could fix it and make it more faster..",negative
"Love this app, my only problem would be that occasionally when I tap on a picture, it doesn't fully load and it gets pixelated.. like 480p.",positive
Very annoying app. It doesn't allow me to change my name . UI of this app looks like 3rd class.,negative
Takes forever to load! Do something guys!! Because the content is great but the eternity it takes to search/load/edit/comment OMG!,negative
"Went to the website and after looking at answers to a question it then told me to register to look at anymore questions/answers. So I registered, it then would not let me go any futher until I downloaded the app. Downloaded the app for Android the experience was appalling so I went back to the website to try and log in but it wouldn't let me in to the website (although I was registered). I have not come across such a bad app/website experience. Unstalled the app, waste of time.",negative
"Quora had been a real life saver for me. The questions and answers from professionals and people who have experienced the same situations, thoughts, and feelings as myself has given me the extra information I've needed given my situation. It's my 2nd favorite app, next to You Tube.",positive
"This app was cool at first, then they start flagging you for EVERYTHING, and then start accusing you of not using your real name and when you go to try to settle it, they won't let you. Then when you try to delete this app and all your data they won't let you do that either.",negative
"Could you let us change font size? It may be too small to read for someone. And when you click a question, you get to wait til it's downloaded. Why don't you make some progress bar?",negative
Informative app but it takes too long to load the notifications even at 4G internet please fix this in ur coming updates.,negative
"It an interactive platorm for learners and experts. Here we can share information, facts, ideas. The app helps us to ask and find answers to the topics that can't be found on google or anywhere. It also helps us answer the questions that people have but most often there is only few people in the world know. Answering those questions gives us the feeling. It satisfies both parties very much.",positive
"The Apps was good, until get updates and being hang... It necessary often happen... Whats wrong with it ? Please fix this bug...",negative
"Id given this app a 4 star earlier. But , i think after a couple of updates , the app freezes while im scrolling through the answers , i try to open an answer and a diff one pops up. Too much of lagging , at first i thought it was my phone , after reading all those recent reviews , trust me I'm experiencing the same thing as those fellow quorans. The website is awesome , just try and fix those bugs. Until then 3 stars.",negative
I don't know what the issue is. But from your last update I'm not able to use this application everytime it just only loading. And then nothing happens. Please check this matter and try to release new update with bug fixed issues.,negative
"Quora forced me to download this app to continue viewing content, even after I had created an account. If they can fix this issue and allow me to view the site in my web browser I will delete this review.",negative
It's good; but the admin has a definite politcal bias. Pick and choose carefully.,neutral
"04-march-2020. Of recent, the app has shown so many major problems that doesn't allow me using the app at all. 1. It doesn't allow me to login at all. [solved later] 2. The number of answers visible to each question is maximum one even if it has several answers. [pending] 3. The answers referenced from a Google search are always displayed with a white blank page. [pending] I dropped email to suppprt@quora, they responded with a reluctance in handling the issues.",negative
I have learned alot And I have been able to get the answers to important answers. There has been things I have struggled with and I got support and was givem great advice.,positive
"Informative, useful. I enjoy reading the articles and content.",positive
Best place to seek and share opinions. Great for brainstorming. It's a wonderful app and good that it's not a place for status sharing. I strongly recommend it to all the wise people.,positive
"Laggy as heck, and the popups suggesting you subscribe to some channels are way annoying as it interrupts your browsing every minute or so.",negative
Worst App ever... i have to restart the app over and over again to just get the pictures coming. Cant they not find a good developer that matches the content. Jeez man!,negative
"Best content. Worst app. Always there will be a bug. Some answers wont open, some answer will not load even if u have very good Internet connection. And many please do a QA before release any version Quora",negative
Really really bad. I don't understand weather these guys are improving app with every update or destroying it. When I click on one answer it opens previous answer. It became really difficult to use this app nowadays.,negative
"Takes too much time to load contents even with high speed internet, and its observed it consumes too much of battery power and also, please provide the dark mode of Quora, can't study much at night.",negative
"The app is informative but too slow also...every process take so many time...so that i have to give much time...which seems like time waste, nothing else...plzzz improve it",negative
"Splendid app with a lot of useful information and entertaining posts. You can gain knowledge from experienced people and get some insight on a topic, understand it better or use it as a time killer to read random little stories or facts. The interface is clean and smooth. Sometimes however it loads infinitely and I have to go back and reclick or reopen the app in order to see a post. It's a minor issue but it's not bothering me much. It would be wonderful if the app offered a dark mode.",positive
The app sometimes doesn't respond. I would request the team to bring Quora in dark mode as well. I normally use it before I go to sleep with my lights off so the white background actually causes strain on my eyes. I don't know how long it might take but please bring dark mode to this app. There is still room for improvement here. Best regards....,negative
"The best way to make your content grow with actual readers, and engage almost everyone even if he's as famous as the president of the US. ABSOLUTELY GREAT INVESTMENT OF TIME",positive

"This is a wonderful and amazing app,for students as well as adults.I recommend it earnestly.",positive
It's incredible app. I love Quora it helps me a lot I can't say thank you in words. I ll say only one thing keep it upüëç,positive
Finally I can browse in peace without the need of re-logging and being blocked with it. Anyways well designed overall and full of informative stuff üòÅ,positive
Interesting questions. One thing I do not understand is how people get paid for their answers. I have have answered dozens of questions to no avail. Maybe it's a certain number of upvotes?,negative
"Very satisfying, because for the quick answers you get on Quora, you would have to spend extensive hours researching.",positive
"Today, I get the get the Ap, I don't want the ap, I like it the way it was. Ok, so forced onto the Ap. Now I have to hit buttons 5-6 times for a response. Goes blank. The new system sucks. I will give the ap another go, if I get the same problem sayonara Quora",negative
Very very poor app. I just hate it. I think they design it for 10G speed. üò°üëø,negative
"Really awesome application to know answers to any questions , kind of google . But please add dark mode for it . Which makes more comfortable while reading. üëç",positive
Surprised to see there is still no dark mode for a app where we spend time reading a lot.,negative
I absolutely love Quora! I use it so much! It's so helpful to find solutions and also relate to other people.,positive
"Forced to download, cant even read the page online anymore. Very bad, ill look for another informative forum.",negative

"Its a very educative, insightful and wonderful app, it delves you into the mind of the young,old and includes a lot of helpful values as well",positive
"It sucks, sometimes it will take 2-3 minutes for even home page to appear. And sometimes it will not even appear, you will have to kill and restart. I don't know what they have done but man it's just text, you can't optimize even that, then your developers are terrible and have no idea how things work. If there would have been a competitor to quora, it will readily lose its users, based on its app quality.Tried once again, and it sucks bigger this time. Quora app really depresses me sometimes.",negative
"Forces you to download the app to continue viewing questions. Extremely strict and arbitrary policies that will lock out your account it you blink the wrong way. Use this service if you absolutely have to. Otherwise, stay away.",negative
Hangs everytime while writing answer also the operation is very slow.there must be an option to remove answer from profile timeline without deleting it.also there should be an option to hide activity forprivacy,negative
"Quora is awesome, thank you for the platform. Please fix the issue where you have to click twice for the ""read more"" link to work. Once for it to blank screen, and then back and re-select for it to work the second time around.",positive
I need dark mode this application because mostly i read in late night but my eye's can't open long time so i strongly recommend please add dark mode in this app and user's compatible to read day&night without any problem. But this really very nice.,positive
Quora is very informative and always give details on about all the concepts that one may be interested in and also give insight into many other topics that otherwise are compex,positive
The app keeps closing every time I try to invite people to answer my questions. Whatever they did on the last update was terrible. I can also not freely select my words to make them bold or whatever action I want to do because the top third of the screen will not let you select words. But other than those two things it's a great app.,negative
"It is as slow as a car that's wheels are punctured. Every time I open Quora, it tells to push so that it can go forward. Too much slow",negative
"You guys like to shove down the app in everyone's throat(when they are smoothly using the website) and ironically it doesn't even work well. Hangs a lot, doesn't load pictures, buggy as hell. I wish there was an option for negative infinity stars!",negative
It's very good app obviously 4star worth it Just a update needed it will be better if there will be a filter for answers based on latest Because if I ask a questio answers are from 2016 Just the filter or sort option for latest answer,positive
"I love this, I don't use it to ask questions, but I do use it to answer other people's questions. And my answers are always 100% honest and are as accurate as possible.",positive
Cannot open this app only home pages opens cannot search anything very bad experience wasted my data to install this app,negative
"The app is lagging to some super duper extent . Whenever I try open up an answer by clicking on read more the app becomes unresponsive . And usually the search results are totally irrelevant to the context or keyword used for the search. Loading time almost all of the images be it answer or tye dp of the answer are just out of bound , you never know how much time it might take. Please apply some repairs sincerely , it would be very grateful.",negative
It is very helpful. It helps to get my all answers and also helps me to enhance my knowledge... It is a better platform ... It offers a lot to learn... üëå,positive
"Reddit-like app. Can answer and post topics of all kinds, even has feature where you can get paid for your contributions! Very buggy app though, constantly freezes and crashes. I use along with website to fully enjoy.",negative
"Quora is better than Facebook, instagram and any kind of social media app. I like it even too much because of its enormous knowledge and good information. Nowadays i use it so that i can learn from Quora whatever i want to learn from my life.",positive
I find the Quora app to be quite helpful however I have not been able to get the updated version of quora to install even after following the instructions from settings at Google Play.,neutral
Great real- life stories and advices that are mostly relatable and educational.,positive
How does this app improve the Quoram experience? It doesn't. What saddens me is that this is new. So in 20 years ...we might see an improvement..impress me...have some vison..so I don't have to have it for you. Thank you,negative
App os still slow... It takes too much time to load .... My other apps works fine but still quora takes few seconds to load. Hope it may gets fixed,negative
"You just can't force us to download the app by pop-ups. I'm a regular Quora user, but I'm not going to install the app. I'm better off on the web!",negative
I am giving it 5 stars but please bring back the Quora's shuffle option. It's great for random searches to pass time efficiently,positive
Information available on the app is good however deducting stars for the glitches and number of times it hangs. As one needs to refresh it again and again.,neutral
"The last update i did messed up the app. It takes forever to load photos or the next question. It just frustrating to use , I've used Qoura for 3 years now and this is the 1st time I've experienced this. I dont want to delete this app but if the issue's are not fixed then i will have to.",negative
App is good! It helps me to understand people's perspective and opinion about anything... But the updates!! Everytime I open app it asks me to update it. This version is no longer supported. Why so!,negative
Not enough info on how to navigate through the app. Much of the content is outdated,negative

"[Update 03/2020] second time today that the app literally crashes my phone. Considering uninstall. [Orig] I love Quora, but this app is impossible. Every time I try to write a long answer the keyboard becomes extremely slow, starts lagging, sometimes disappears. If I try to go back and edit a part of text above it starts writing where I chose, then goes back and forth to the end of the text and up, keyboard starts glitching and often the whole text will just disappear.",negative

"It's perfect. Wait up, some people are super rude on it at times. I think there should be some terms and conditions about how people give information or ask for information on it",negative
Ouora is the best questions and answers App as well as the best site in the internet to get every knowledgeable informations about miscellaneous items. A very very hearty thanks to the Quora team for making this wonderful App as well as the site which helped me to gain more knowledge than I had.,positive
I was searching book stalls on google...the result redirected me to the quora page but when i started reading it on quora within a few seconds quora redirects me to its homepage instead of staying that page..,neutral
I like this the only thing is a lot of people use this for therapy and you search your name up and your personal stuff is all out there. I would say don't let you know seriously personal information get out in the public about people because like the narcissistic groups and everything describe very dangerous people and people don't realize it's all over the internet.,neutral
"Quora uses casino inspired techniques to draw you in and maintain your attention, when they replace the infinite scroll with pages and start incorporating deliberate stopping ques into their design language I'll reconsider my opinion. Maybe a twenty second delay when the app is opened to give the user some time to breath would be something to test out. No matter what decision they make they will make the right decision.",neutral
who the hell doesn't allow selection and copying in their app or even for Googling things? Oh well hell yeah the peculiar decision makers in Quora! Edit: I have increased my rating from 1 to 5 because they have fixed this problem.,negative
But I'm missing the possibility to cache data for offline reading. But still amazing.,positive
"Apps really awesome, there are millions out there to answer your questions and you can find others having mutual life problems and you can learn how others are dealing with it and the best part is you can post any kind of question and there are so many out there to encourage you and you get diverse suggestions..",positive
The APP is terrible. I can't even type a paragraph length reply without it crashing on me. Completely bugged out my phone.,negative
"Would be great if you could incorporate a Dark Mode in the app. I appreciate and love all the other changes you've made to the app interface, the aesthetic is a lot better. However, I'm unable to read Quora at night because it hurts my eyes after half an hour of using dark mode apps. Please incorporate this one feature.",positive
"It is OK, just don't put it on a default because then it will pop up whenever the h*** is wants to! Over all it is pretty cool if you are looking for privacy or a browser that has U torrent/bit torrent connected to it so you can watch your downloads at the same time as searching for things to download. And I need to do a little more research on this Web browser, application but over all stance is I mostly have a problem with my desktop application. laptop version I do not like so much. This1iDo!",neutral
"It's interesting and informative. But it leaves you hanging. The story starts off good then it just ends.

"Downloaded the app just to say its ridiculous that you make the person download the app when I was perfectly content using my browser. Thank you for wasting my time, now unistalling and finding a new site.",negative
Answers take too much time to load even with good data connection. Pathetic experience.,negative
"Very interesting subjects being discussed, but you have other subjects or questions that can easily be answered with google.",positive
I am addicted to this app there are so many different ideas and topics. Some lift you up others will just shock you! Easy to use and navigate too.,positive
"I tend to ignore mainstream or pop culture subjects. Interesting discussions of the obscure and arcane are much more my style, and this joint has'em in spades. Not saying that mainline material isn't in here, most assuredly it is...just haven't looked.",positive
Overall performance and content of the app is appreciable ..but one star less ..why don't you guys have dark theme . Man ! It hurts for longer hours reading on it while white light being emitting from the screen.,negative
"First of all, Quora forced me to download their app to view the contents, which made me upset whenever I opened website of Quora in Chrome. I, forcibly had to install the app. App was good for viewing content, but is full of nonsense ads. Sometimes, the App misbehaves, when I tap on view more, it wouldn't respond and brings me to the top. The Condition got worse when I had to write an answer. The App hanged like Hell. Every time I write a word, its first letter gets repeated twice, which sucks!",negative
"I took out the 4 stars of 5 I had given because of the mediocre UI I get on my mobile! There are bugs in the app(I use Redmi 4 by the way) , for example, when I click on Read More.... Instead of opening the answer, It gets initialised to top which is a bad UI. The photos in the answer doesn't get loaded properly( partially loaded) . And it would never show a single answer when the connection is a bit slow (somewhere around 50-200kbps which is a not very slow). Please do correct it.",negative
The content of quora is good but I don't like their attitude of forcing the app to you. They just want you to download this app to view their content. Also I couldn't read the answers today which was very frustrating and then I realised that it is now forcing me to update the app. This is not at all fair as it should be upon us whether we want to download the app and update it or not. This shouldn't be forced.,negative
"When I click on 'read more' on any answers, it does not show the rest of the texts and after few seconds says 'Try again'. It happening for past 3 weeks, earlier I was able to use it without any problems. Now, even after reinstalling I can't read any full answers. Disgusting!",negative
Definitely love it! It's 5 star but i want it with dark mode x'D My eyes need to feel less irritated to continue reading everything this app offers (Once dark mode comes i change to 5 stars haha) :D,positive
"It's a very informative platform, I really enjoy it, it helps m to be an informed person!!",positive
"I liked the app but nonetheless, the website is the best. The reason i say this is because the app has a poor interface on some mobile devices, out of which one happens to be mine I have no OS or android version based issues as I ise a galaxy S10 so I dont know the reason Devs please help",positive
"For goodness sakes, STOP MOVING MY ANSWERS TO LESSER RELEVANT QUESTIONS. I put a lot of time and efforts into writing absolute answer to a question, the way it's asked, but then you keep moving my answer to another question that's asked in another way. This feature is ridiculously awful.",negative
After the recent update can't see anything on the daily digest. Its always blank. Earlier apps were slow too.,negative
"I have experience that, Quora platform ( Marathi, Hindi,English ) is not as much reliable, trusted as Wikipedia is. Many of answers are mere Whatsapp standerd and Quora should remove such answers.",negative

"Worst experience for a last few months, It is irresponsive and very slow to type answers on Gboard and on SwiftKey. Please fix it. It is my favourite app on my phone!",negative
This app doesn't work!!! It says can't connect the internet but I have no problem using other apps!!! Fix it quick!!!,negative
Quora is great but I find it find it annoying that you cant browse on the internet only through the app. They basically force you to download the app or you dont get to use the site.,negative
"I love the website, but I hate that I always get popups for this app. I find myself avoiding Quora links in search results because of this, which is a shame because I really do feel I find the best answers on Quora if I didn't have to worry about popups for the app.",negative
I really hate having to have the app to view questions vs. just quickly viewing them in the browser,negative
I love using quora but the app is very show. Whenever i open a page having some images. It takes minutes to load.,negative
"Fix it, please. I don't often use Q., but I googled smth and it led me here, then I saw another question that I was interested in, but the web page won't show it, instead is says ""Quora is better as an app"" and I have only two choices:either I say I have an app or I want to download the app. I can't just skip this and continue reading, the x-button below is not working. Ok, I downloaded the app, logged in, and now it just transfers me to the main page. Are you kidding me? I still can't read it.",negative
"It is literally theeee best app for me right now, the questions are quite exotic oh, and the answers are surely interesting to read if you install it now you will probably be waking every morning to check on new questions postedüòÇüòÇ",positive
Literally the worst android mobile app it shows time out the very moment i open it while it works smoothly on my laptop.,negative
Idk why but for last few days I haven't been able to ask any questions...idk why but that totally sucks...it always displays that this question has already been asked when it hasn't been... please help as I want to ask question on the platform...,negative
useful in various way but almost forces you to download the app and log in to gain access (mobile) so that sucks. just want to get the info i want hassle free but the need to log in and download. maybe would only use like once every 4 month. almost pointless to download app,negative
Great for brain stimulation and conversation ideal Great I can share information and experience that will that might help someone else,positive
"Cannot log in from browser, cannot confirm my email because the client refuses to accept that I wanted to submit a comment 3 times and I didn't get a prompt until I restarted the app and none of the links in by email want to work. This application does not work.",negative
"Even one star is more I wish I could give zero star.I used to love this app before 2019,before 2019 it used to show the whole topics I followed down side the screen of my phone but after an update it only show 7-8 topics which are followed by me recently and all the other topics are vanished from my ribbon.when I search any topic it shows me I am following it but then why is it not in my ribbon.i hate it",negative
The app is very slow and after each update it is getting worse. However the website l is very good.,negative
"Had a bad experience on the Quora app. I actually like Quora very much as it has many interesting questions. But I can't access Quora on my mobile app, I always need to use the laptop. For some reasons the app does not load on my mobile, it always shows a white screen that it is loading but the loading never stops. I always use other social networking sites like Facebook,Twitter,Instagram on my mobile, so I assure you this is not a problem of my cell phone.",negative
I have been using Quora for a long time . But recently I have started getting following issues ‚Ä¢ your recommendation system is badly trained .If I view two three questions in a day then when I visit the next day it's shows mostly related question (80% of the questions are similar question I viewed earlier ) it's gets boring please change the weightage and add new questions ‚Ä¢ Quora freezes often after 2-3 page ( maintain 8- 10 preloaded pages) ‚Ä¢ lot of adds it's getting annoying,negative
"First time feeds page loading takes considerable time. Images takes irritably more time. High data optimisation is required. Added this review 2 years ago, still no improvement from quora team. Videos on instagram load faster than this app. Dissapointing botg as a user and as a developer.",negative
I really like the app. Never had any issues with it. I get most of the questions I have answered through using it also.,positive
"Couldn't load quicky when i tap on ""see more"" after few taps it will open and we need DARK MODE because we read everything on quora so it very necessary dark mode on it.",negative
Equal parts entertaining and enlightening. Easy to get lost for hours learning about things I didn't even know I cared about!,positive
Until this week Quora was a favorite. Now i repeatedly get an ad to download the app. i do not want the app and cannot load it because i dont have enough storage space. i will unsubscribe and then mark as spam if you continue. i really liked your site. sorry you had to ruin it. It is now March 2020 and again i cant read unless i download the app. I am really tired of this.,negative
I couldn't able to sign in. Every single time i restart the app and trying to sign it was showing the same login page repeatedly. You have some serious bugs in your application that you are not aware of. Hope you will devlope it soon.,negative
Excellent experience. Wide variety of subjects are covered. It is quick reference guide.,positive
"Worst App Ever.. Quora is not ment for mobile. Hated it on browser, hate it on app. Using app you can't even link URLs in a answer properly.. HATE IT!!",negative
So many bugs and you guys don't even remove them in your updates.... I keep clicking on the answer and it just doesn't open. After numerous clicks it opens but then it opens several times... Guys please do something about it,negative
App was very useful but Please improve the interface of the app it is some time uneasy .And also improve the features in it .It features are very confusing so please update with clarity.,negative
"While there is lots of good Q & A content, it is diminished by the huge volume of troll questions and those posted by members of Quora's Partner Program, which pays people to post questions, regardless of quality. Only quantity matters.",negative
"Great app for bored academics, good to find information and answer questions. App functions as it should so far, not glitchy or anything.",positive
"Awesome app, discussions about just about everything. Good time killer and learning platform.",positive
"guys this app isn't working with Airtel 4g, what's the problem I love this app but now it is getting ridiculous, uninstallingüò† Edit :- Issue solved (happyü•∞)",negative
"This app constantly hangs I don't know if it's my phone or no t but I can get extremely frustrating especially when I'm writing an answer, the cursur never moves and sometimes when I'm writing on another line the stuff I'm typing appears in a different part completely ruining everything, fix it",negative
Q & A are thought provoking and informative. Appears to be slightly biassed politically. Overall I like the app and contents. Photo and video inserts may be considered if possible.,positive
I enjoy reading people's questions and answers and also enjoy answering some of them myself.,positive
"This app keeps being bad. It keeps loading, connection to the internet is the worst.",negative
The most lovable app. This app doesn't make me feel alone in my loneliness. The writers are fantastic. Even 5 stars üåü are less for this app.,positive
"Quora is a very useful App. Answers in this App are mostly given by youngsters and Scholarly Academics specializing in various higher studies. We can have many answers for our single question. The answers are elaborate and detailed. They are highly reliable and prescriptive. The Quora App, is more specialized than 'Google search, Wikipedia, and other websites'. Thank you all. Wishes.",positive
"Knowledge can be improved through this app,wider perspective can be developed..on various issues, subjects etc.",positive
App experience is terrible.Website was good enough and you really need to stop forcing people to download the app.The app has completely ruined my quora experience.,negative
It is good but sucks in messaging system..messages gets sent multiple times Quora moderation policy collapses answers unnecessarily .. moreover many fake accounts are prevailing which needs to be taken into account.,negative
Quora happens to be one of my all time favorite App on the Google play store. It helps you get answers to questions you never would have gotten answers to. Please keep it up and continually bring updates to help our learning experience. Thanks again!!,positive
"I love Quora, I really do, but this app is brutal. I'll tap on an answer to open it, wait a few seconds, and it won't open so I tap it again. I do this a dozen times and it shows the ""opening"" animation a dozen times. It is incredibly laggy, and the UI has been declining steadily. Website is about ‚àû√ó better.",negative
"I uninstalled this app because it is not providing night mode .. it is not good to use this app at night time. As quora is meant for reading, night mode is a bare minimum feature for this kind of app",negative
"I have one request to the manufacturers (as I have seen many manufacturers to be careful about reviews) that I am unable to open the app. For a lot of days (about 2 month), I haven't used it and now when I am again again badly trying to open the app it's repeatedly showing ‚Äúcan't connect to the internet - try again‚Äù in spite of full 4G VoLTE internet connection. I am facing the problem for 3 days now. Please do the needful. Otherwise, it is very useful app (especially in study related issues).",negative
Pretty good app. It's not slow but it seems to kinda hang up every once in a while.,positive
"It's excellent!! I can get different answers to my questions and expanding knowledge. Also it can educate with various pages, and topics found inside it. It is better to download this app and have it in your phone as a second knowledge searcher. Big up guys!üëçüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæüôåüèæ",positive
It's good when U comes to reading and experiencing new things but the time it takes to load content is too much slow which is literally very annoying . Some time it takes 2-3 minutes to open up the home page .,negative
"If you really want to force people to use this app instead of a web browser, then idk, make it faster? Let pages load a lot faster and implement the use of tabs to open two or more questions.",neutral
Easy to use and does what it should. Better then using a browser due to the customisation aspects. Very reliable,positive
"So,i was like OMG when i first discovered this app.i think while searching about something and the complete and satisfied answer made me happy.The idea of this app's mind blowing the app is overall good but I'm giving four stars cuz @quorateam you should add the copy paste option here.thank you",positive
"I just Dont like the app . When you try to google Something and you find Something important here in quora and when you click it , you cant see the answer because you have to go in the app and when you go in The app , you cant find it and it lead you to the main page. You have to scroll the whole page and waste your time and search the answers you want and still you cant find it.",negative
"I'm not sure what happened, but Quora just quit opening on my phone (LG Stylo 4) as of yesterday (3/16/20). I've tried restarting/rebooting multiple times and have even completely deleted and reinstalled the app from the Play store just to see if that would fix it. Nope. Nothing works - it's broken.",negative
"I enjoy the stories and answers to the questions. I don't know why when I click to expand a story, it has to flip through 3 or 4 pages that dont open before I get to the article I wanted to read. Then click it again to read it. I'm confused.",neutral
"Good app most of my answer especially academic question are provided answers and are quickly given after each of my post, but just one things is that the notification seems to delay a little bit late.",positive
No continuous reading .Everytime you have to open and close .very frustating .,negative
Actually wanted to redownload the app to see if there was an improvement. Lo and behold my old review is gone. So here you go 1 star. If you can't handle criticism then don't even bother.,negative
"I only downloaded the app because the website keeps blocking me from reading questions with a big 'download the app' message that once it has appeared I cannot remove. I don't want to be forced into using an app that takes up unnecessary space on my phone. I just want to read without interruption. In addition, the app craps out while I'm in the middle of writing and answer about once a day and then I can never find the question I was trying to answer to add it again. You've pissed me of Quora.",negative
"I think this is the nicest version of social networks; educational, communicational and entertaining.",positive
"There are some amazing people on this site. People giving you personal insight on things instead of some text book. People reaching out to help one another with comfort, support, and compassion. Every topic out there, every mental disorder, EVERYTHING can be found here. Just be mindful there are always those bad apples in a bunch, keep your eyes open and if they don't seem right, chances are they're not. This is an amazing community of People!!",positive
So I have downloaded this app to see how fast this buffer compared to the online app. But it was still the same and. Iwas disappointed.,negative
"Apart from being a Good Reading Platform basically, there is no doubt in the recent days that in answering Questions of Current vibrant topics, Quora is somewhat becoming sluggish day by day !",negative
"I have always enjoyed using Quora, while very informative it also provides various view points from individuals a over the world!",positive
"Changed my life, broadened my horizons and introduced me to some of the worlds best writers.",positive
I love this app because it's full of useful and interesting information from people who like to help and inform. Can thoroughly recommend it.,positive
Very nice application...gives good information from professionals and experienced ones.,positive
There is no dark mode. The notification setting take up to four seconds to load each category and subcategory.,neutral
A very knowledgeable app with a great level of informational topics on pretty much anything you would care to discuss. The moderators are hawkish though and comments that are not even abusive will sometimes get collapsed. It seems to be political on something which should most definitely be apolitical.,positive
"Best ""social media"" app in the best sense of the word. Who knew there were so many thoughtful and knowledgeable people out there willing to share?",positive
"The content is terrible containd serious misinformation, terrible answers, political answers for completely non political questions. Besides the app is slow have to wait for over 30 seconds for the home page to load.",negative
"I daily read my favourite topics in Quota. It's easy, fun and I find myself more informed and educated",positive
"Deleting and going back to using the website. It's really bad. Typing has lag and sometimes the cursor just skips and you start erasing sentences or it just weirdly starts typing in the middle of a word. Also straw that broke the camel's back is just now i typed an answer, it was a pretty lengthy one. I hit finish and it's just gone. It doesn't exist. What a waste of time. It's not the first time and not the first phone I experience this on. BAD app.",negative
Really good app for when you are curious to know lots of questions. Everything was good until today when the pages weren't displayed properly. Please fix it ASAP,positive
"News channels are not to be trusted nowadays. This is an app which provides you with personal point of views of common people as well as experts. It also gives food for your brain, i strongly suggest make a habit of using it instead of social media apps.",negative
The app sucks! It reloads completely every time. As if I am opening on the browser. The app could be better...,negative
"Very Slow App, You need to enhance its features. Images load too slow. It is needed to enhance the features of this app. It's too limited",negative
"Wish there was a way to add details to the questions themselves, and some of the constraints the app puts on are a little silly, but it's find besides. Good for giving and getting advice!",positive
"Things have gotten better since a year ago, however half of the times I click on Read More button, and it opens an empty page. I have to go back and re-click it in order to see the answer/link.",neutral
"The app doesnt works properly most of the times,it gets hang frequently. I have been facing a lot of issues in loading feed,making comments and many other operations. The developers should look after these things....really frustrated from last few months that i have been even thinking to uninstall it though it was my favt app. Thumbs down 2 stars from my side.",negative
"This is a nice app but still it has less reviews and ratings. I have found it over years that this app has a single deriment of underdevelopment or lacking in modifications. If it would progress at reforming a better outlook, then I can say it by a bold voice that it is the formost information app. üôÇ",negative
"The website itself is fine, but the app SUCKS... Repeatedly tried to log on with my normal email, Wouldn't let me, accidentally logged on with my Gmail account and could not Log out and change it.",negative
"Good - but frequent updates, 3 in a week!! There are lots of irrelevant and childish questions. Some are so basic, that you only need general knowledge to answer it. However, some answers are just fantastic - increases our GK tremendously. I can sense the tremendous efforts taken. Hats off to such characters.",positive
"Pathetic, Taking ages to load even the home page. Had to close the app and then update to check if it resolves the issue. Still the same. Uninstalling now.",negative
"More than a year since I started using the app. However, it crashes after about 15-20mins. Other than that, it's a great app, good for knowledge. Dear developers, please fix the problem. Or maybe it's because I use an outdated android device. Still then, can't complain...",negative
"Love Quora, but the app really sucks. Uninstalling Quora now because since the last update it won't open or load anymore. Bad gateway error is all I get. So over it anyway, people only want to argue about anything you write. Too many negative and mean people now. Good bye, Quora.",negative
Quora is like must have productivity applications with its user friendly UI but still there is a little problem that it doesn't have dark mode!!,negative
"Great concept, but developer is stingy with features. Make the app feature rich and with options. We're humans - we love options. Let me have the options to adjust text size and to toggle night mode. Just stop being too rigid!",negative
"Without any reason Quora has blocked me for questioning, Which is very annoying to me. PR response is very poor, Hoping for good relations with Quora if it improves in responsive communication like other social media webs.",negative
"Still no dark mode, unlike my web browser. But I can't use my web browser to browse Quora on my mobile phone, because Quora decided so. On top of that, writing answers from the app is a real hassle. Some words disappear when typing too fast or moving the cursor. This is a good way to test your tolerance to incompetence.",negative
Works really fine one request though since most of the apps are moving towards having a dark theme it would be good to see one in Quora it would really improve the experience,positive
Honestly this is the best app ever everyday I learn a new fact or trick. Thank you for making my boring days very fun.,positive
"Extremely white UI, why no Dark Mode? I'm uninstalling this application until there is a dark mode. It hurts my eyes, blazing white background. Sad, from Quora.",negative
A very good website. I learn a lot of inknown and interesting subjects on it.,positive
From last update quora take too much time to open and always it is in loading form.quora should take care about this problem..,negative
Every now and then the app stops showing the feed. This is application where I spend most of my time but now I am tired of it because of the issue. Otherwise the application is good,negative
"It is an amazing app for me , gets me all the answers and helps me answer alot of questions and refresh my information However, if there was an option of recording a voice answer instead of only typing it, it'll be way more helpful and easier to use this app. I can get to answer double the questions with the same time.",positive
"Don't want to download the app but can't navigate the website without a pop-up I can't remove telling me to get the app. Just awful UX, let me do what I want!",negative
I had this app. and uninstalled it .Now when I access it via browser quora plagues me with pop ups promoting itself thereby losing my place in what I was reading . Maybe I should blacklist it and find a less pushey source of information. Bye bye.,negative
I read quora. I change app for a while. When i get back to quora. The app refreshed its content. And the content i am reading is gone. And i cannot find it again because its already refreshed. Frustating,negative
"After strengthening its Security, it has again occupied position of being Fab App. T Though its already simple yet good, time has come to change its UI to be the best. Hope makers will think about it soon.",positive
"This is a window for thirsty people who search for complete information and knowledge on a certain topic, may it be nuclear reactor or the most beautiful model at this moment, alongwith diverse opinions! This is not Wikipedia because it is not a passive provider of knowledge but a livid tea table of discussion, arguments and exchange of ideas on anything and everything!",neutral
"Not really feel good with recommend question (compared to recommend post on facebook). But after all, it's the best social apps i've used ^^!",positive
"I used to like Quora before. But now app is totally ruined. The app nudges you to use ""spaces"", you get notifications for session with people you have no interest with, you can't merge multiple languages in one feed, No dark mode. Current UI is good but will not stay forever. Advertisements come in form of actual content. People get Banned for no reason. I wish Quora app could be as good as it was before.",negative
"Very nice platform if u have intrest in writing and reading.. you can learn and express what you want,..",positive
"It's so incredibly ridiculous that they **force** you to download the app to read some of the questions. Obnoxious and pushy tactics, deleting as soon as I get the answer to the question I need and never using this site again.",negative
"Pls make a bookmarks only by the title, bcs scrolling down to search what I've been added as bookmark is wasting time.",neutral
"App won't let me log in, it redirects me to signup page then says account already exists. The website let's me view a few pages then opens app that does not let me sign in",negative
What's wrong with you? Stopping me from reading an article just so you can bait me to your app? Think about the people that don't have space on their phones. Websites are there for reason you know. Deleting once I read my article.,negative
This is the best app for advice and entertaining stories. People with lots of expertise such as doctors and college admissions counselors are on there to answer your questions. Totally recommend!,positive
Worst optimization for Android users. The app continue getting crashed. Whenever try to ask question..it doesn't respond for few minutes.,negative
"Very informative and good reading material in spite of the troll posts. Unfortunately I am leaving and never going back again because of the racist ""bot"" which keeps deleting those of my answers it doesn't like. Congratulations.",positive
"Interesting app, missing night or dark view for battery preservation. No updates for dark mode, it's damn bright!!!",positive
Content is quite good . You can explore and discover new things in areas of your interest.,positive
It's quite horrendous. The website is much better. Yet they keep pushing this app on us ü§î. NB: Updates do not include notes.,negative
A very good and informative platform. But now it is degrading. The app features are good though,negative
Very informative and interesting app. Other apps are nothing in comparison to quora. Overall loved it.‚ú®,positive
"Forced to download. I simply want to read something on the Quara site, but they keep popping up a window ""do you have the mobile app?"" And the pop up does not close Why can't they just allow visitors to view the content on a mobile browser?",negative
Painful. Does not let me read content on web without prior installing the app. Content quality too downgrading,negative
"When I read any answer in browser it demands me to install app. But, the App is very slow. Some times it does not get open at all. These issues Uneasy to use Quora. At least allow people read answers in browser if you cannot develop good app for quora. Please resolve the defects in quora app before insisting people to install it.",negative
Feeds are not of a use. Trying to convince the users to spend more time fails miserably To the extent that I started hatin' the app. Recommendations must be minimised,negative
after one question i was already blocked from adding more... not to mention the audacity of this apps very existence and constantly begging to be used wheb internet version os accessed,negative
It was good. Especially who appeared competative exams like jee mains was facing good in mathematics,positive
"Found this app on my pharmacy app, it is very educational about human behavior, if you have questions or worries about someone you can ask questions and have mental health professionals answer your questions... interesting and helpful...",positive
I really like this app but when ever I am scrolling the white blank always appear but there is nothing loadedüòî please help fix the problem.,negative
"Greatest app ever made. Knowledge unbounded. Unlimited real life experiences, life changing stories. Thank you team Quora",positive
I face blank page when i use it and i can touch any things. I delete it and download it again but I face same problem ‚ö†Ô∏è if anyone knows how can I solve this problem plz send it to me ASAP!,negative

"While i am all with the idea of Quora, the app sucks, it seems as if some school goer has built this thing up.. while the website is good. The app sucks.. I mean super sucks.. please improve . Its been more than 4 - 5 years the app is in pathetic condition.",negative
It is an amazing app for me any. And it's in my top 10 app. I use refer anything in quora anyway. Whenever I need something to learn or any doubt i would take a look at it. Nice app,positive
"You force users to use your crApp (dickmove btw) but fail to provide the same level of functionality as a browser. I immediately reject anything that doesn't have a dark mode, please add one.",negative
"Very bad app. I have just answer the questions of some people on how to download movie. And therefore, i also shared a link in the answer.And they banned my account by saying this that i have violated their policies. Worst promotional app i had ever seen if there is a option of zero rating i will give this a the same. Don't waste your time.",negative
Worst one... Don't compell us to download this app... If we want we can download.. Time is just wasting and it's not even reponding too.. Better to see in chrome itselfüò°ü§¨ü§¨,negative
Awesome. Why don't Quora has an inbuilt pop up (overlay) dictionary? It will be quite useful if there is a pop up widget like dictionary feature when I select (long press) a word in any of the anwers whose meaning Im unaware of.,positive
"I love quora, but I would really appreciate it if this app had a dark theme and was more customizable.",positive
I really enjoy the interactive news and information. Questions and answers that are thought provoking.,positive
"Profound Quora reader and writer, since last 2 years and counting more till it have food filters and content recommendation I think .",positive
"App was so good earlier when they were providing only contents but now only adds. App can crash anytime, it will load very slow, because of showing advertisement.

"very interesting. i only have one thing i would like to be amended: the possibility of choosing letter size. some posts have really small letters, and tho interesting, are a pain to read. Oh, and since the last update, for some reason, i can no longer read my quora in lanscape. Where are the settings? March 2020. Same issues.",negative
User experience is not that great and fluidic. Need more features and simple user interface. Now full of ads in every corner,negative
"First of all how can you guys force us to use the app!? You should keep the option of browser content open and the use of browser/app should be customers choice.. secondly if you are so adamant about the app, then please make sure the UI is user friendly, has less hassle, viewing content n writing answers is more easier. Otherwise the hard earned reputation will definitely go down because of some stupid choices you make.. Lastly happy for quora and its content tho..",neutral
too informative. where we are listener as well as readers. very well . include other spaces and area of interest also. like stitching designing and book reading,positive
User interface is really bad. Things get load very very slowly..,negative
App is dead slow... there's nothing on screen for about a minute while I stare at the grey lines... Then it loads the page with a lot of clutter around. If you actually want to use the app make a good one may be a lite version...,negative
Site is nice and topics are really cool. BUT IT FORCES YOU TO DOWNLOAD THE APP. which i really dont want because i just want a specific question answered but no. You have to download an app to have it answered. Bullpoop.,negative
"A Worst app Unable to open at slower internet speed.it takes too long time to load.after trying long time decided to uninstall it,now I feel better than using this app.",negative
Its takes lot of time to load questions and when you guys are launching Dark mode..its been 1000yrs.I mostly use quora in nights and it hurt my eyes and thats why i cant read more than 5 answer . Plz launch dark mode soon....üôèüôè,negative
What the f*** is wrong with Quora. I had to forcefully download the app while I was surfing the Quora website in Chrome. It didn't allowed to read further until and unless I download this app. Very disgusting Quora. Very cheap marketing strategy üò°üò°,negative
"App is Absolutely RIDDLED with deceiving ads. I just counted, litterally every 5 questions, is a fake question and answer that is just an ad. very disappointing.",negative
Annoying. The fact that you must be forced to use the app to access the website it just waste of time,negative
Useless app people mostly ask here useless questions although it can help you to improve in some field info and topics and if someone answer there questions they don't even bother to thank you and the people in this community is pretty noob I just asked the simple question and most of them weren't even close to the answer I would suggest you reddit. Funny thing is if you want to open this in browser it will force u to download the app they won't tell you that it's one of worst optimize app.,negative
"It always acts funny, never saves my upvotes or retracts them right after. I can't recommend because it won't allow me to fully use the app.",negative
"Its great spending time on quora , you used to get some knowledge in your leisure time. They provide you a platform to present your knowledge too. It's a quality app to go with.",positive

"I have been using Quora for a couple of years now. It is basically a Q/A app, but very informative, professional and makes reading much enjoyable.",positive

worst app I have ever seen. the user interface is very bad and the app keep showing error after few minutes..,negative
Addicting but frustrating. Answers often won't load unless I click and press the back button multiple times. Recently started not loading at all. I hate that they took away question details. Many questions don't make sense without it. Still some people's stories are addicting but it's kind of like banging your head against a wall sometimes. Ads are getting more annoying on it and I think it's sacrificing long term success for short term profits.,negative

"When i took new mobile the first thing i did was install quora app from play store because that's how much i enjoyed quora, but this app is really bad, it takes 5 min to load one answer. And i cant read answers in browser also as quora makes it mendatory to install app. At least dont make installing app mendatory or make it work faster. I wanted to give 0 stars but that's not possible.",negative
Takes lots of time to load images and content please work on this issue .I'll rate you 5 again.,negative
"I have learned much from others' questions & comments. I truly feel satisfied within that I have finally located an awesome venue to tell of my experiences & thoughts, ideas, & get to answer delightful questions, meanwhile. This site is terrific & interesting to me. We all seem to be benefitting in various ways. I am saddened, though, because of the amount of young people who seem so depressed &/or may have lost their way. I'd sure like to try to help each one of them. Life is to be enjoyed.",positive

Quora is good but app sucks... most of the time when I click on Quora notification or external Quora link it opens the app but doesn't load the question/page.,negative
"When i press continue reading to an answer, it takes me to the top of the page, without opeining the complete answer.",neutral
"Its a perfect app for educational and information purposes. But i only have 1 problem, the app requires a crazy amount of data to operate smoothly so i hereby just wanted to say that it takes a lot of time to operate this app so it is better to directly find answers to ur questions from quora itself but from Google instead of app. Please fix these bug kindly.",negative
Becoming useless after every update. Can not even do the only thing this app is meant to do.,negative
Netflix charged $31.97 for a free trial I CANCELLED For the past year unbeknownst to me i survive on ssi no statements no bank acct glad they got to rip off $175.00 Only realized when they sent an email re: my acct ? Crooked co. Horrible exp.,negative
"I come to quora for questions that can't be answered by a Google search but since there's no way to add details to questions it's impossible to get helpful answers bc not all questions can be asked in so few characters! Plz add a way to include extra info to Q's (that can't be easily overlooked by people reading the Q)! Maybe add button @ end saying ""question has details, click here to view*...SOMETHING..ANYTHING!",negative
Very informative . Got a lot of information from a variety of life lessons learned . Thank you for sharing. So some of us won't have to learn the hard way.,positive
"Very bad experience ,most annoying, the news feed take so much time to load and then just freezes ,tried opening and closing the app but didn't worked",negative
it has no video sharing option besides it has to be more user friendly.,negative
"The app is good for real information, straight from writer to the public. But the questions you ask are limited in information",neutral
It hurts my eyes when I read at Night. I seem can't find any dark mode or anything that shields my eyes from the brightness no matter how I turned it all down. What I do is just invert my colours through my phone's settings. Sometimes I feel lazier than usual I just let it be and let my eyes slowly fry itself.,negative
"Sometimes I just want to learn about something based upon the information I can garner from those who have specialised knowledge. It may not be perfect, but it is always very informative.",positive
"It freezes whenever I try to scroll. Then I have to go back and click on the question again. Only scrolls after like 3 tries! I mean, why do you prevent from reading answers on ur website when the app is trash, and has many bugs.",negative
"Very useless if it won't let you access the app basically at least when they have a new version. And insist you update or be locked out. Insists you open in app and doesn't take you from the Quora webpage you are reading to the same page in-app. Horrible if it blocks off the whole webpage, just so I use their app, when I just want to check up a single webpage. You should learn from Twitter and Facebook. Your tactics are horrible.",negative
"I like quora, but their team is not responsive. Most of time when you try to reach or contact their support team their app crashes.",negative
Why you must recommend to download the app while reading from browser it is better to open many tabs at once in the browser ..unfair,negative
Sucks. I looked from google and after having being forced to set up the app and sign up just to look at a question I was looking for and not get the right answer. It's a waste of time completely. I took more time getting here than it's taking me to write this shi##y review. Dont not go with this big mistake. Dont waste your time like other have,negative
"Love this app!! Not only is it easy to use, but its mindboggling exactly how much information and knowledge is crammed into this app. Ive missed learning new things daily like back when I was still in school. This app fixed that craving. Everyday theres new topics, questions, answers, posts, stories, experiences. If you cant find something your interested in on Quora then you just must not even be trying. To me this app is so much more then upvotes and views. Endless Well of Knowledge!",positive
"The link from notification cannot be opened, it only shows placeholder and the content never get loaded.",negative
Supresing medical advice during a medical crisis. With a catch 22 pop up banner that forces you to this page. And will not let you view complete awnser pushing you to download an app. I personally have no storage space for anyway. So no way to access the information. Quora has an intellectual comunity that spend time contributing knowledge to an open source database. Alot of it being medical experience advice and advance.. To suppress information like that is a total injustice to humanity...,negative
"Great user interface, it's simple and easy to navigate through and presents information in an easy to digest way. Some improvements could be made to the smoothness of scrolling and matters regarding that (It stutters quite a bit on my Galaxy S10). But overall, a really clean and unique way to find what you're looking for.",positive
"Website requires me to download and use app even though I have a quora account and am signed in. Total inconvenience when I'm just trying to read 1 specific article but cant without being redirected, and now that specific suggested article is gone. You would think the other 1 star reviews would invoke change in this annoying system but what companies truly care these days",negative
The platform is great for the work that I am doing life coach emotional healing empowerment.,positive
"Consumes hell a lot of data!!When I search for a particular topic and after reading a particular result if I go back to the previous page by pressing the back button ,it just displays a blank page . Several bug issues are there . !! Pls correct it . Also crashes frequently . . .",negative
"Hate that it forces you to download the app to view some content when using a Web browser, but then has less features than a Web browser such as ""find"" text and downloading pictures. Make the app more robust or stop pushing it when it already works in a browser. I'm already signed into quora account on Google chrome for goodness sake! I'm already a fan!",negative
"Great for researching general ideas, opinions, experiences, and/or fun facts. Be aware that information provided as answers to the questions you ask or research, may or may not be actual, real facts. Frequently, I see stories of others' experiences and opinions on topics. I wouldn't use this for proven, clinically researched facts...however, much of the shared experiences can be useful if you need an undocumented general answer to questions pertaining to life or if you just need an opinion.",positive
"SUPER UNSTABLE APP... They focus on content not on experience. I loose lots of drafted answers half the way. Forget leaving screen...buttons do not save data Screens crash... Feeds change when you are reading it... Phone goes hot while writing answers Battery drains 1%/min Language keyboards stop working randomly ... Bonus - this all circus happens on latest stock Android (9). Basically if you want to build an app, you visit quora app to tell your developers how not to BUTCHER your app.",negative
"The app is garbage, the website tries to force you to download it, and they act like a ten year old can't make a fake email. This is a waste, do not bother wasting your time or phone memory on this garbage fire app.",negative
"First thing is even when my internet connection is perfect, answers take forever to load. I can download a song in 3 seconds but answers on Quora would take about 25 to load. Second, even when the answers are loaded, the pictures that some answers contain take about 3 minutes or more to load. Third, this platform is biased. You cannot call out Pseudo Seculars and Communists without your comment or answer being collapsed or deleted. This is unhealthy for a platform which is meant for Q&A.",negative
"Quora is mostly moving towards subjective questions. Emotional hogwash, memes and just blatant sarcastic or poetic answers. To a point its all fine but then it becomes disgusting. But thats the problem with free sites. Genuine answers that add value to my life are rare. Quora recommendation engine needs work.",negative
App is badly infested with bugs. So much delay in loading data everytime. Please hire a better development team. I'd rather use Quora in my browser than being frustrated with this app.,negative
"quora please please , best thing u have is best content ,but there are a lot of glitches i have sufficient net speed to run youtube ,even surf dark web but on when i click on read full article ,it jams there , and it doesn't load pictures fast enough and a lot more. please correct them .",negative
These stars on previous experience. But now this app doesnt open and it doesnt work now. Very poor,negative
"Ouora itself is a reasonably good platform for passing time and finding out a thing or two. The UI also isn't bad, and has a clean consistant look. However the main problem with the app is its performance. Of all the apps I have, it is the only one which is able to completely crash my phone's UI. Writing anything is a nightmare as it glitches out after a couple of hundred words, and even when in the background there is a hit on performance. Other than performance, I would give it a 4 star.",positive
"very beautiful social but it gives chances to anonymous re presenters good scope to express their grievances to Individual/ social non justification etc but before publishing those should be justified through its editors, hope would be done so by the Quora Editorial section! Thanks!",positive
"Atrocious app, sluggish like dead er slug. You type and the text update so far behind I thought ud missed something-typed it again, and while you're there growing old it Suddenly appears! Useless.",negative
Dark mode is desperately needed in this app. I hope it will be in next update. Sometimes app also got freezes.,negative
"I have this on two devices. It takes fifteen minutes to write a post because the app changes courser position at random, closes my keyboard, or ignores inputs. It crashes daily.",negative
I removed the app because where I stay the network is very weak and the searches on your app don't open when the network is low. I want to use Google chrome to access my quora account since it doesn't bother me at all but I am now being forced to install and use an app which won't work. Basically I am on a checkmate where I either download the app and it doesn't work or try using chrome where ill be forced download the app either way. P.S. I am using my phone not laptop to access the internet,negative
"Great app. I've had it for about 6 months now and use it frequently. I have had no issues with it, but I do agree that it needs a Dark Mode.",positive
It has loads of information some genuine and few that don't merit mention. It is upto us too judge. However the sheer range of topics discussed is incredible.,positive
It is good but would be better if it had a camera to scan the questions. Would make user experience better.,positive
"Very bad app, I have ever seen. I love Quara website but not this App. Because, there are lots of problems, e.g.- I can't question and answer through this app and I can't click up-vote and down-vote button at the time when I need. Moreover, there are lots of problems which is not possible now to write. Actually, there are innumerable problems. That's why, I am going to uninstall this.",negative
It is often laggy. My internet connection is stable but Quora app can't load anything.,negative
Why the hell photos disappears automatically if I click on any answer? Every time I open the pictures gets blank.. white screen and nothing else. Same goes for the website. Fix it.,negative
"Enjoy reading and writing, then this app is for you . well built app to share knowledge and views. every one can answer/ask the questions.",positive
I was very glad I found this interesting app. But recently the app has turned so annoying that the main purpose of sharing knowledge has been overshadowed by propoganda articles flooding the feed. I've personally felt the indian assossiates whoever concerned with moderation and regulation is blindly backing a political party suppressing all other voices. kindly do the needlful to monitor blind north indian political writers from exploiting the vastness of this otherwise wonderful app.cheers !,negative
Cool app and all but the amount of notifications it generates is actually insane. Who tf is going to open let alone read 50+ email per day about useless bs? Takes a good 5 minutes just to turn all the notification off in settings there are so many. If a developer reads this please make a way to turn all notification off easily. I've went through the settings twice and still seem to get email cramming my inbox.,negative
"Good one, Now new features like content of photography and other valuable things are great addition.",positive
"Very bad experience. I always research and create my answers. I follow all the guidelines and try my best to keep my answer neutral and unbaised. I try to write helpful answers. I have got good views and upvoters. Inspite of that, Quora moderation deletes my answers. It says that my answer violates the policies. When I appeal for the same, I hear no feedback/mail. Simply nothing. When I go to contact us page and try to fill the form, it suddenly says error. I can't even ask for reasoning! HELP!",negative
The app is great üëçüëåüòä we feel a change life after we get answers of questions about life. Other kinds are great too.,positive
"I love this app so much as i can see that i spent a lot of time scrolling quora than any other apps . There are a lot of fun issues, facts and experience to read as i love general knowledge . But, this app needs to improve as the notification post uses a lot of time to load , and sometimes seems to stop responding . I need to press my phone harder to close a post i've read. That's all. Love the content so much xx",positive
I'm not downloading an app for everything on the dang internet I'll I would be happy to answer questions but I'm not downloading another app to my phone and for me if they want me to download an app to look at some things then it's just a waste of time I'm not one of these people that has a gazillion apps for everything nor do I sit on Facebook and post nonsense about my life because that I'm so insecure with I have to have other people tell me that I have a good life ridiculous,negative
"Editing mode (when suggesting edits) needs to at least have a back (undo edit) button. It is already extremely slow when I can only provide edits online. Needed to provide many edit suggestions for a very important, and longer answer but had to give up because it was a huge pain in the ass and a significant waste of time when I was very far through and then it screwed up due to delayed input, causing unintentional deletion of a portion of original content and I couldn't undo it to continue.",negative
"The apps started to lagging and crashed when writing the answer for a long time. Even to upload the pictures is taking a very long time. The interface currently going to be better, but it's still have a lot of bugs. They need to focus improving the functionality and solved the problems.",negative
"Interesting app, however I not sure how much longer I will keep it. I wish that I could just read the content without all the up voting and all the other nonsense.",positive
Very interesting aap. If I open this don't know how time passes away. Very informative aap,positive
"The environment itself is really good, but neither the app performance and UI. It experiences a lot of lag and couldn't even response a simple selection, thus makes it crashed my whole phone system. Please revamp the optimization and rebuild the interface so that we could read and write the entire content easily without hassle.",negative
Absolute rubbish keep loading screen comes out of nowhere i have a good speed tho. (wanted to give 0 stars),negative
One of the most brilliant apps I have ever used in my whole life. Quora has helped me every time when I'm in need. Truly one of the best apps on play store.,positive
"Whenever start quora, N click on question it always stuck. Do not open, then suddenly open 3-4 times. I am not facing kind of issue in any other app in my mobile.",negative
the only good reason to keep this app that it removes stupid open in app message . the suggested QA on home tab are worst there is even no option to mute some specific topics only thing you can do is downvote or report .... like really?,negative
"This app sucks a**. I'm not hating on Quora it's an awesome place to gain knowledge but this app doesn't do justice to this awesome platform. It's filled with bugs. For ex- when I try to open an answer it wouldn't open for 15-20 seconds, not able to upvote and many more. The developers must be high on weed while making this app. 1 star for now. I'll increase rating if you consider fixing all the issues.",negative
Please improve your quick image accessing Some times the app lags. But the app is good especially youngsters should use it. Please improve it nowadays seriously this beautiful app is lagging..,negative
"I really want to spend more time with quora because it's feels like i m sitting on couch and reading the books, actually i love reading and writing this app helps me to gain huge amount of knowledge..",positive
Just needs a mark as read button. It will be really nice if it provides user a mark as read button as sometimes we see repeated posts. So it will be easy to distinguish between read and unread.,positive
"When I'm in a post, there is no way to get the link to the question for sharing. Also, if I click a link in the post, I have no easy way to go back to where I came from. Just using the website is a much better experience than using the app.",negative
A little slow and doesn't open the article fully (you have to expand it each time to see the whole content) Everything else is great. Fix that to get 5 stars.,positive
"What the app providing is really great, but the problem is the time which is required to load a page especially my top stories (my digest) and also the other stories as well. üëéüëé",negative
Quora runs very very very slow. Sometimes it takes more than one minute to open something,negative

Notifications are received much later than the actual event. Sometimes 10-15 mins later.,neutral
"Any app which has a fully functional website, a glitchy app and FORCES you to download the app to see anything is up to something. If I don't want to use an app that slows down my phone, then let me use the website.",negative
App is terrible for slower internet connections and night time use. Introduce dark mode yo and please optimize cache usage.,negative

"Quora is a great initiative, with your questions answered by people from different walks of life. You get to see different perspective towards a single or a topic. QUORA is not only a QA app but a networking community where you can learn, meet, discover new people, talents, information. It has been nothing but helpful.",positive
"I really love reading and learning on quora but the problem is we quora readers need the option to get night mode in quora in next update, its annoying to read in this light . love quora. :) Also if you could include the translate option to convert written text in our language of choice to read it in, it will be great coz not everyone in india is well versed with English and will help readers a lot!!!",positive

Too much bugs.... Everytime I open any question answer and whenever answer is lengthy and a button appears of 'continue reading' and you've to press it to expand the answer.

I don't have such this problem with any other App on my phone. (i have 3G of RAM and 650 snapdragon) The performance of this app is very bad. Not friendly UI. Sorry i had to give a one star to be noticed. Since i like Quora.. I'm looking for an update to fix this problem.",negative
"It's an addiction. Quora is an intricate online platform of writers and the sense of community is like nothing else. I've made so many friends, written so much, and absolutely loved it.

"Could have given 5 stars. But, due to weird moderation over my few answers has made me to do this. Else, the rest things are cool!",positive
Why can't I just browse through your online page without the useless pop up coercing me into downloading your stupid app that I'll ultimately have to delete. Better amend this or risk getting more 1 star ratings!,negative

Great app but please fix 2 issues: The video upload option is missing when i try to write an answer. The app hangs. Please fix it Devs,negative
My mobile does not support Quora....So I am unable to operate the app. Moreover the update is not getting downloaded. Thanks.,negative
I think it should be the convenience of translation in other languages. More this site is a good experience for me.,positive

The worst is when I try to read a thread in the browser but it forces me to open the app, which goes to its main page, so I have no way to continue the thread.",negative
Content wise good but performance wise its sucks. Hangs while opening images. Also does not refreshes smoothly. Content loading is an issue.,negative

I love this concept of quota but the app is performing pretty bad. As soon as I open the app all I get is 502: try again nothing else. Fix this problem please?,negative
Constant notifications. Literally every 45-50 seconds. It's insane. And the app's notification settings make no sense. Only way to stop it is to either block all or just uninstall (my recommendation - uninstall. You can read on the web without the notification abuse.),negative
This was Best app on play store for education. But nowdays its take long time in loading any answers even with good internet connection. Update made this app crash please fix it. Going to unistall this app.,negative

The Partner Program is ruining the forum. I only get absurd questions from Quora Partners trying to increase their activity. Nobody wants to answer my serious questions any more. I no longer want to try sifting through the elementary ones to find the serious ones. I'm considering deleting the app if it doesn't change.,negative
Nice one and had anseers for many questions. Useful for mobile learner and persons who have curiosity or leisure time for answering questions of multitude variety.,positive

This app is in serious need of an overhaul or at least some work to fix some bugs. I am constantly trying to dismiss a question or tap on something and the app doesn't recognize it or will keep recognizing the wrong tap. When I try to answer a question the text is super laggy and will add letters and words that I'm not even typing. I've tried things on my phone but its definitely the app that needs work. :(,negative

"It actually should have been a really good and useful app. But this app just have so many disadventages, such as we cant delete our posted questions until the grace time is up, It doesnt have 'details for question' feature-which is make us forced to write down the details on the comment, etc. Mainly if those two things will be added into quora, it will make this app turns out to be the best 'knowledge-sharing' app.",negative

"If you're a writer, keep in mind that this app, for now, is simply unusable for lower end Android phones. It just takes too much time to respond to your inputs and that just putts off all your productivity mindset.

"Useful app but sometimes does not respond properly. For example, when I try to open a content (answers, post from spaces) from home page, other contents (another answer, especially the answer which I previously opened and seen) gets opened. Updated many times, but this doesn't get fixed... Please bring dark mode feature.",negative

I have always & continue 2 have issues when I try 2 type a Comment. It is constantly crashing on me. I just received a Device Maintenance Alert stating that this specific App was causing a major overload on my CPU & had 2 b closed. I am sick & tired of dealing w/all the Technical Issues & am fixing 2 Uninstall. Which is highly upsetting 2 me because I have been enjoying all the information I am able 2 read about. Not 2 mention the immense amount of knowledge I've gained about a personal issue.,negative
"it's impossible, literally impossible to participate via commenting or writing answers or any other activity requiring a text entry field. After the first couple of sentences it... just.... starts.......... t..... o.. drag.......... and I always give up.

"Previously rated at 5 stars. However, Quora's backend engineering is abysmal. Shortcuts were taken early on, which makes 5 series errors (error 500) very common and the mobile app completely unusable at times. It consistently loads the wrong answer, loads it 20 seconds late, or refuses to load at all. It is a complete mess. I will change my review back to 5 stars once this is fixed.",negative

very slow app. it takes a lot of time to open and the screen size is short because it has three different layers which are unnecessary 1. Home layer on the top 2. Home layer on the bottom 3. spaces layer above the bottom home layer. previously it used to show the answers i upvoted now it doesn't. very time consuming and pathetic experience.,negative
"I can write a Quora answer to list out all the bugs in this app. But typing long answers makes the application lag even in flagship phones. Moreover, the app is just a web browser. Please invest some time on developing a good app rather than spending on meaningless moderation policies.",negative
"The app is baaad, images suddenly disappear when reading a post, Very slow to load, I prefer the web version",negative
"Seems like the Quora team gets together and discusses ""How do we make the app worse than it already is?"". Answers don't load up. You click and answer and some other answer loads up. You have to open an answer multiple times inorder to upvote it. The app is an absolute mess right now.",negative
When I am searching for something very important I am getting suggestion for every 10 secs. I am facing this from past few days post Corona.. hate this feature. Fix it as it does not allow us to read the content rather takes plenty of time in closing the pop ups that keep blocking. I have a screenshot of the pop up as well. Irritating stuff,negative

App is great but there should be a night mode or dark mode as the bright light makes it uneasy to use at night,positive
Have some bugs and glitches and crashes sometimes. But it doesn't affect your experience because it happens rarely.,negative
It's better to login to Quora in Google Chrome browser and use it rather than this useless app. We can use it in dark mode for hours instead of letting this app burn our eyes out.,negative
Simply the best source of any credible information and intellectual discussions. I love it.,positive
The app is marvellous.You can ask&find answers from anything to everything&there's lot of people best in their field to give you the real&undoubtedly the expert answer.You can even ask for a advice for your problems or confusions in your personal life&there are many who share their life's best&worst experiences which helps a lot.I can just spend hours reading&writing answers here which is much better than being hooked to others.One of the best knowledgeable app I have ever encountered.,positive

I have had enough with this app. Initially it was good. Now it is a place for hateful people and advertisements. Worst app. Good answer are deleted. Politically controlled. Open political advertisement. Thoughts Hateful and intolerant about religion exists in quora. It is now more of use for people with no work. I'm sure that quora has got no decency to respond to it back. Poorly managed. The 2 stars it earned is because of 2016 and '17 experience.,negative
Lots of information on subjects from people's personal experience which I find really helpful especially in area of mental health and drugs used in psychiatry.,positive

They appear only when i restart or reload the content manually. I'm afraid quora is loosing it's fidelity. I'm updating my review again. The error hasn't been rectified. Please rectify this",negative
This used to be my favourite app till 2015-17 but the interface after that has become so irritating that i hardly open it anymore! The pop up answer window system lets you read only one answer and deviates to irrelevant topics and endless advertisements. I could not believe what's wrong with the developers. It's become more pathetic than tic tock! So much do that i took out time to write a review before deleting it!!,negative
"Awesome app bt need some changes like fix bugs ,it takes almost 1 minutes to launch notifications nd please make updates and enable dark mode features",negative
"Have been a long time user on both desktop and Android. Both experiences have severely degraded recently. Earlier flaws were discounted because Quora had smtg no-one else had- like the uniqueness, quality, variety and credibility of answers. Now every one of these- and I mean EVERY- pros are gone. There're better apps -like reddit amd YouTube- where I can find more relevant information. The final straw is the horrendous app design. So much lag in opening answers?! WTH üò°",negative

"Whenever I write an answer, it begings smooth but after typing 200 words it lags badly. I cant type smoother. It gets worser when I reach at 300 words. Makes me Unable to type further. It was good before. But now it is loosing its shine in the curious community.",negative
I like this but generally to kill time because since its from so many random people putting there input in..its not always factual..but It is alot of fun and entertaining..so if u want something to kill time and read peoples incite of ask a questions and have real people give incite this is a good app wanted to give it a four cause it is a good idea but hard to do when like I said it's not all factual..but hey it's fun so give it a try..you can kill hours reading peoples input in topics‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,positive
üëé forced app updates üëé Spaces. Quora was much easier to use when it was a simple Q&A website. üëç There are many high quality questions and answers. These are getting difficult to be discovered among the low quality posts. I think the search and suggestions algorithms on Quora need improvement.,neutral
"I love this app for the treasure trove of knowledge it has. But whenever we bookmark any answers, it's difficult to go to the old bookmarked answers since there's no filtering mechanism. We should at least be able to categorise by year. Have even given feedback on Quora but to no avail. Hope the team considers the request.",negative
Makes me stick to it...best means to get exposed to wide variety of things happening Edited 20/4/2020 Now being slowly filled by nerds and jerks to make it another facebook writing fake and false articles. Quora has lost its credibility. Uninstalled it.,negative
App interface and website interface is poor. Qoura please improve. Don't ruin yourself.please,negative

"It used to be a great platform for knowledge sharing till a few years back. But now, it's full of advertisements and facebook like garbage content. You have ruined everything what quora used to be.",negative

"I like Quora, a lot. I spend a lot of time here and I've learnt a lot over time. The app is on the other side one of the worst things I've seen in a long time. There is so many bad things about it: Its slow, it's spamming you with notifications and the way you handle notifications is really tiresome and not very user friendly. You can't select what orientation you'd like to use it in. A lot of things is hidden behind a ""read more"" button but pressing that button doesn't reveal rest of the test, it usually load a completely other view (which is slow) and many time you end up seeing another answer instead.",negative
"Actually, I answer far more questions Then ask questions of my own. It is far more efficient to ask on data base that provide far more information than just a basic answer.",positive
This app helps me alot by providing best information of anything whenever i need. I would have given 5 stars but I think a dark mode feature will make me to do so. Please Kindly add Dark Mode Feature so that users can read answers at night also without facing strain on their eyes. Peace.,positive
Back to using the mobile version on chrome. The app doesn't support darkmode.,negative

Quite an irritating experience especially while reading an interesting answer, it hangs and have to repetitively refresh the app only to lose the answer I was thoroughly enjoying reading. It was much better till last year.",negative

Garbage app. Forces you to register ok fine I did..now it forces me to install app..just so it can bombard me with ads and push notifs... Uninstall immediately,negative
"Connecting people of different fields to solve doubts.. inquiries.. get advice...nice concept and platform.. But it has become substantially cluttered with lots of duplicate questions-answers, spams and quality control is a very major issue! Like people asking questions simpler than what a play school student can solve",negative
"Sorry, this app and site are not what they used to be. It's one thing to update apps and websites which can be a good thing, but most just give them features that are a total inconvenience. Sorry but no longer allowing a description that goes with a question and only allowing a link is not an improvement. It's an inconvenience to most in their right mind. Also, too many rules, too many people anxious to report others, too many tattle tails, too P.C. Sorry Quora, but we're done. Forever.",negative
I really enjoy learning tidbits of information and different point of views very interesting,positive
"This is the best knowledge providing app ever. My son is able to all his doubts in many science subjects like physics,chemistry and biology. It helps a lot in his studies.",positive
Quora is very useful to get the relevant information from the experts. Very good platform to have a dialogue on different topics. I am enjoying this apps.,positive

It goes blank sometimes (dark) when i try to read content. I click read more but it comes out black.,negative
Good app to know people views. Also available in many languages.,positive
I rhink there are some intetesting questions. I am wise from 79 years of experiences and enjoy giving what I think are common sense answers. I hope I helped a few people find their answers. I do get frustrated with the app when my replies are constantly mixed up and I have to delete and redo so often. It takes me twice the time it should. It's still an interesting site.,positive
A treasure trove of interesting content. I especially love how they notify you of your upvotes so you feel like you're funny.,positive
The app opening is so slow..we must wait for details to get loaded... The website is best it opens content fast but quora wants up to install there app to use wch is of no use... Pls developers look after this problem... I frequently use quora n this is frustrating...,negative
"It is a good platform for sharing knowledge but what makes me give it 1 star is that the application is totally messed up. It takes an eternity to load at first and reading answers is headache because it does not open the answer you clicked but previous one, sometimes multiple layers of same answer are opening all at ones, it crashes very often mostly while it's not even lagging. These issues must be handled, otherwise app will not remain as popular as it was.",negative
4 stars because It still does not have dark theme and no green mode as it's kind of a reading platform,neutral

You will find a lots of answer on almost the topics you are looking for. It's very exciting to read experiences of persons when that situation comes to you.. I love it.. üòç,positive
This app really needs improvement. I had to uninstall it. One star was lowest rating they had. There are so many problems with the app the stars need to go in the negative range. That's the nicest way i can say it sucks.,negative
"Very usefull app for study, motivation and information of various fields.",positive
"Horrible too frustrating, when ever I try to ask question it just pop out for edit and moderation.. I hate this . This app is just good for answer but not for asking.. Multiple i tried manytimes but always same irritating message and thus my questions are not published",negative
Overall the app is great. But unfortunately there is no option for dark/night mode.,negative
"Pathetic experience. Is it so important for you to download the app or get interests of user just to read one article. You asked for account verification for the article, I understand that. But knowing users interests or force download is irrelevant.",negative
If you are interested in answering questions and you can ask your questions too. Then definitely you must try this app. It is useful for students as they can get their satisfaction with many related answers of a question. Try it once you will love it.,positive
"It's a highly addictive app like social networking sites. But a side apart, It provides plenty of knowledge in both the aspects of a point either postive or negative side .Infact, every day- to -day life issues are answered and explained with a lot of explanations which I find that is very useful and that's in this application makes it work like a addiction üòÖ to me .",positive

The app sucks. Stupid popups asking you to join spaces everytime u open a thread make me want to delete the app. Stop with the constant popups,negative

"I have been using Quora on website for a long time now.

Please.",neutral
Awesome app. It's filled with informations and the conversion sought out thousamds of my ques. Thanks for the help quora. You kept all of us together.,positive
A few more features can be added like night mode and offline reading.,neutral
"Few suggestions: 1) I don't mind you showing ads, but differentiate them. 2) I keep seeing repeated promoted posts in the same page. Please improve ads & promotions. Stop redundancies. 3) Please make muting topics easier.

"Excellent app, however can u please fix the bug that prevents me from seeing pictures after 6 seconds i view the question. Thanks",neutral
"Very slow. I always have to wait for more than 5 seconds for a response after clicking posted content. Every other app works well on my phone, reddit, instagram, fb, but quora lags. Accessing quora on a browser helps but I'm constantly bothered by a notification that forces me to use the quora app.",negative
"Amazing app, I love it! Though I've recently had a problem of the app closing when inviting people to my questions. I have a brand new Samsung A70 so the phone shouldn't be an issue.",positive
The app is a little crowded and cluttered. often times with minutae. I'm tempted to call out several of the answer seekers as lazy Google researching! Admittedly it is fun to read of others experiences and 'stories'. With the exception of science and medicine i cant help but saying out loud 'really now?' to many of the answers since they lean heavily towards sensationalism and less towards solid answers. i guess we're into term paper 3 ( . ) 0hh now as more students discover the app.,neutral
"A bit overboard with the amount of adverts and the home feed comes across quite untidy. Too much going on and think it could be more aesthetically pleasing if it was simplified a bit. But overall, good app.",negative
"Sick quora stop mailing me I don't understand even after blocking you, how I still keep getting your mail, get lost, I am not coming back. Garbage app, they got my review deleted, this is a spy app proof is more the 94% have given 1 star rest 3 stars, how the app showing 4.5 stars, your guess is as good as mine. The 5 stars are mostly fake and people probably not using this app anymore.",negative

"Verification of email is not working. I tried resending but it does not work after I click verify in my email. When I got back to the app to use it, it tells me that I have to verify my account. Also I tried changing my email. I installed the app back after deleting it and used a different email account but after I placed a password, it tells me to try again later. I did as I was told to so I waited, but it was still the same after some time.",negative
"You asked me to confirm email before I could anonymously ask a question. When I went to the email to confirm, it said to use the latest confirmation email. There wasn't any option to resend the email anywhere. When I tried to post the question again, as it had disappeared, it took ages. Adding...... Not good experience at all.",negative
"The app just didn't open , answers doesn't open . Horrible suggestions are popped up every time.",negative
I gave 3 star. What I suggeat to a developer is that Please add offline features to app where we can save a question when we are online and read it later in offline mode.,neutral
"It freezes a lot when I am in the middle of an answer. Stop, clear, rewrite.",negative
It's an useful app but often it says it can't connect to the internet. I couldn't open quora for a few months! Still having issues. Don't know how to fix it.,negative
Website Forces me to download and use this app which I don't like and don't want to.. It's enough for my questions be answered and scrolling on. Downloading and installing an app - It should be a choice not a compulsion or an obligation.,negative
Every time when i click on a topic to read quora opens a pop up asking do you know kannada langauage .. i clicked decide late but even then it showed the same Pop up when i click other Answer.,neutral

I request you to kindly check it up asap. Otherwise the app is great.",negative

Very bad experience since last 3-4 months... Never opens during day time even my net speed is very fast... Don't know why it is behaving like this,negative

One of the most positive knowledge sharing platforms on the internet. In love with it. Sharing amazing information and knowledge. Undoubtedly my favorite app.,positive
"The website is cool. The app is absolue garbage. Whenever I try to type an answer it slows down my phone, I can't go back and edit a previous sentence and just now it deleted a lengthy answer I tried to write in spite of the bugging keyboard.",negative
"I'd like to browse Quora on my web browser without being FORCED to download this subpar app. This behaviour occurs even when I'm logged in on the platform in my browser, which is simply unacceptable. Not a smart way to increase user engagement / revenue Quora, quite the opposite. A greedy platform that used to provide insightful answers and took a turn for the worst over the years. This attitude is one of several reasons I now try to skip Quora when it appears in Google search results.",negative
Now a days I'm unable seeing more answers for any question. Before and all if I open any question I can see 100s of answers but now it's showing only single answer and can't able see all answers of that post..it's bit annoying.. Because for one question we should take lot of decisions right that one itself missed before this feature was there ..then what is the use of this application if you guys can't provide more answers for single question..that s why 3 star rating else 5 is worthful.,negative
Don't understand why the pages take too much time to get loaded. Slowest navigation seen ever! Marathi version has the worst labels and translations. You have just translated English strings word to word in Mararhi which mean nothing when read in Marathi. Work more on Marathi version and hire some wise people with good Marathi grammar.,negative

Please remove this feature,negative

"Too many annoying pop ups about news feed, really ruins the reading experience when everytime you scroll down this pop up comes",negative
Very annoying feature is bnbr which has become a weapon of choice for trolls. the site should be without any political or social viewpoint leaning but it does and anyone who annoys or offends the sympathies of Quora gets blocked. the site is very biased in many ways because of this Bnbr feature and it's unrestricted and arbitrary enforcement by moderator there is no such thing as freedom of speech in Quora Only good comes from the many great contributors with great content,negative

So many glitches and bugs. It hardly loads the pages now. Fix it.,negative
worst application. Takes too much to load content even if you are sitting near a high speed wi-fi.,negative
"It takes too long to load. It would be fun to read several articles a day, only if the homepage loads fast. Youtube or Pinterest can load their vids and pics 10x faster than this one.",neutral
"The app somehow drain my battery quite significantly.. at first, i thought the lack of dark mode caused this, so i inverted the screen color thus it'd be solved, but No.. not at all!? This app really need dark mode and better battery optimization",negative
What is this thing with spaces. It keeps popping up on my screen. It's so annoying. I have stopped using the app. Funny thing I don't miss it!,negative
"I liked the concept of quora..but the app has several bugs, it is blinking constantly...",negative
In my experiencelthe therapist and some of the people give the wrong advice to the wrong people and what they do is cause a lot a lot of damagethe therapist on hair need to do a one-on-one with some of these people with real issues,negative
they lead you on to sign ..... then they ask u to compulsory select 10 topics.... then they also asks u compulsory to select more 5 topics.... ü•¥ and so on... they only collect info to sell it to third party!,negative
1 year later and I still have no desire to download the app. I'm even more determined to never do so no matter how many times they try to block me from reading with this advertisement.,negative
"Why do we have to update the app all the time? It's my personal choice. I'm okay with all the features I'm currently having, and I don't want to update. However, I still want to use the app. I know that you aren't gonna fix it and so am I my review. 1‚òÜ permanently üòåüòí",negative
"I love quora and have been reading it in my spare time for years, but this app might just be the end of my time on the site. Quora has made it impossible to enjoy their mobile website through the browser without installing this app by putting in pop up ads for the app that cannot be closed, forcing you to close the page you where reading part way through or install their app. It ruins the browsing expirience and it needs to stop.",negative
"Once again you threw the Quora app modal after spending 5 minutes on the website. I know you want me to download the stupid app and get off the website, So I did. I did just to write this review and to tell you to stick the app in your ear. Now that I've said it I'm uninstalling it . I'm also going to use Quora to find a Quora replacement. I bid you good day.",negative
Pop up my space suggestions window is annoying in Quora. It is popping up everytime I am scrolling to a new feed.,negative
"It's a nice app.... lots of ideas and answers to deep questions from intellectual minds... basically, a great app.",positive
One of the very slow app I have ever used. Quora's web application is much much better and smoothly runs than its mobile app. Quora should remove login required in its web version so that it can be read without login.,positive
"This App has become a mess! It's way too cluttered and annoying. The ""We found spaces for you"" box keeps popping out of nowhere. How many times do I have to close the box to let the app know If I didn't like the topics the first time, I'm not gonna like the SAME topics the 100th time?!",negative
"I don't appreciate being on the mobile site and then having a pop-up to download/use the app when I'm on for five seconds. Once the pop-up comes up, I can't get rid of it or get back to the question I was reading. It'd be fine if the app wasn't terrible, but it is, and now I can't even access the mobile site without being interrupted.",negative
"STOP making popups appear on your website, you can't close, forcing you to download the app. People don't want your app! They just want to read it on your website!",negative
The app is required if you want to use quora on mobile. More ad revenue this way? The app is OK but I'd would rather use the site.,neutral
"I will be deleting my account. I can no longer read any post on the web. As soon as you start scrolling down it stops and tells you app is better and boots. If I wanted the app I would ha e downloaded it already. But to force someone to load it is over handed in my opinion. And from the reviews, the app doesn't even work properly.",negative
"I enjoy Quora. It's interesting, informative, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking.",positive
"I do undrstand that Quora is doing a good job of providing infornation to the youngsters, but of late I am getting very silly questions like very routine information available from search engines like google . As a person willing to help .I find it time consuming to filter the questions which desrve an answer. So, it is better to introduce file ring to remove these trivial questions to save time and effort.",negative
Like the details provided to answer questions. There appears to be a reasonable amount of research involved in fact finding & educating readers.,neutral
"Significantly worse than website, although required to view certain content, for no other reason than to have to use app. Not being able to change font size, and pressing view more can cause you to lose position in scroll is the main reasons why I rate this poorly.",negative
You can be reading one post and it will jump into another one you cannot find the one you were reading also if you do not have the app you can be reading a post and you get a flag fly upses install the app and you can't do anything else they can go to hell as far as I concerned,negative

Very annoying. I dont have space in my phone. And website Doesnt allow to use in web browser. Its cumpolsay asking to download the app.,negative
Forced into installing this app. I was perfectly happy accessing quora on mweb. My phone doesn't have extra space for this app but I'm not being given a choice.,negative
It is really best app for students or learner. This is best app because anyone can share knowledge and get knowledge. One of the best app for students as it supports student a lots.,positive
"Forced to install the app. First of all the website has too many ads. Secondly if you scroll down an answer, done with half of an interesting answer and boom, force users to install the app.",negative
A Single Star Rating for this Application is not enough for it. Google should be providing Negative Marking/Ratings for this kind. App doesn't load easily and if it loads then it doesn't respond smoothly. If we Uninstall and use the site from the Browser then the page does not work. It continues to ask to download the app. Absolutely mindless application.,negative
"Worst performance I wish I could give it minus 1000 stars. In just 15 min my phone heated like hell which never happened. When I click on an answer the previous one opens. Seriously, what tha hell is this?",negative
It's very annoying to be forced to download the app or else we can't access the content. My device has little memory capacity so I'm unable to download it. If I am also unable to access the content from the web on my phone then there is no point.,negative
"Popup for this stupid app keeps appearing unless I download the app, don't need it and don't care for it.",negative
This is a very useless app and I am furious that I am been made to download it. I barely have memory on my phone and I don't need this app. This is bullying. I don't need or want this useless app.,negative
"I had the app but i had to delete because i wasn't seeing any usefulness of it, you can't read people's comments and in total is a pain to use. I prefer the website but im forced to download the app which is not fair. I think it should be by choice to download the app. Please step up. I don't want to download the app please",negative
"After a very Rocky start, my smartphone & the Quora app finally decided to communicate and recognize me at the same time. It has been enjoyable for several years now.",positive
"I really like this app and its people. I would give 5 stars if only it had a dark mode, light mode is annoying most of the time.",positive
It takes its own time to open and a bit of a nuisance to use. I simply installed it just to get that persistent ad to go away,negative
"I've been aware of the bad 1 and 2 star reviews about the Quora app. But now, Quora insists that I use the Quora app or it pops on screen so I can't even finish the article I started to read. That happens over and over. It's sick.",negative
"The most useful and interesting social media app, if you like to read you'll love it. Sadly its website is way better than the actual app. But this thing forces you to use app rather than website. I hope you'll make the app more user friendly so you don't have to force us.",positive
"Bad User Interface... - Loads slowly. - Difficult to scroll continuously. - Every time need to click to read content and then press back to return. - No provision to download images. But, +User friendly with Google Chrome.",negative
"Whenever I open any quora content on browser it forces me to install the app, i dont want to install app due to insufficient storage...very bad experience.",negative
"Doesn't work in landscape, which makes it worthless on a tablet. Started getting constant annoying pop-ups on the website, again, so have it another try. It's a a year later and the app still doesn't work in landscape. This isn't that difficult, guys.",negative
"The internet view is better than what in the app. It is just easier to scroll down , tap on good questions and just read than to go a new tab and again press back button to get in home page .",positive
I tried this when I joined Quora but gave up as it was so slow. Because the website started constantly trying to force me to use the app I did. It seems much better now.,negative
I only downloaded it to rate it poor coz I keep getting interrupted when I'm browsing quora on the web. Stupid app !,negative
"Yo, Why is the new update so buggy, sloppy, unresponsive and choppy. I am using a Redmi Note 5. The previous update ran fine but this is ridiculous. Edit : New problem! The answers will take forever to open all the time, even though my internet speed is good. And if the answer opens it will not show comments, it's just stuck till the position where the answer finishes. And when this particular thing happens the upvote button will also not work. Great Update! Edit 2: I uninstalled the app!",negative
"Hogs the phone, not responsive, back button does not work etc,. Bad interface design!",negative
"The app isnt bad, I just hate it when I'm trying to read something through the site on my browser, and it wont let me continue. Will not Download this app on my current device, because that is just more hassle.",negative
Why my home is not refreshing? My internet connection is good and i tried updating the app.,neutral
Downloading as its the only way to view the website on mobile. Was perfectly happy using a web browser but now they lock you out of reading articles. Will drop to one star if the app quality is bad.,negative
"I used to be avid reader on quira. But for past few days, app is not loading the content. Dissapointed.",negative
"It's really good. There is a lot of unknown knowledge that people who have experience share. And I always get the best info, insight and knowledge from Quora websites.",positive
"How stupid is FORCING your user to use the app when he is prefering to view quora on the website mode in mobile browserüò°(It should always be the customer who decides which service he wants). Thoroughly irritating behavior. Oh, and the app is such a crappy one, slow to load and with no user-friendly experience the mobile website gives. - a very agitated regular user( reading on quora is a delight. So much to learn from varied sources and people, but this behaviour is wrecking the experience).",negative
I want to access it on browser. I don't want to jump to the app. Let it be user's choice don't force it. It's making the user experience disastrous.,negative

"I love quora dont get me wrong but when i just want to read an article that got emailed to me/scroll through on google. It is incredibly annoying that a thing saying to download this app keeps appearing with no way around it just let me read what they wrote! I tried everything airplane mode,going back etc. but it just keeps coming back and not only do i not want the app but i dont have storage. Apparently i cant use quora then.",negative
"First, I love Quora the website. The app tries to reinvent the wheel and be the website and serves no purpose except to suck. The website breaks your experience regularly bugging you to install this app. I finally gave in and installed the app. The website STILL breaks my experience. I hate this app for that reason.",negative
This app keeps popping up and wont let me read the free one that appeared on my phone that I never downloaded. It's messing things up. I downloaded it once but the letters were to big and I couldn't hardly read it. I can't get it to stop!!! Help!!!!!!,negative
Hey quota FAK OFF. The only reason I downloaded your app was because you couldn't stop Interupting me with your pop up ad. Just so you know. I DIDNT WANT YOUR F'N APP. but now I have it gee thanks.,negative
This is one of the best app to gain knowledge from all spheres . I find it very interesting to know something new everyday . And specially at this time of lockdown it is a of great help to spend time at home.,positive
"Edit : 03/05/2020 I previously tried Quora app and didn't like. If you want me to use, make it user friendly. Stop trying to force it down my throat with this ""download the app or I already have the app"". Even if you make the app useful I can't tolerate this bullying. I will quit Quora if it's continue to ruin my experience. Old Review - I don't want the app. I can't open multiple tabs like in chrome. Even when I don't want the site is forcing me to download the app.",negative
I am not able to view all the available content smoothly. Using browser is far more convenient.,negative
This App keeps popping out asking to be downloaded. Very irritating. I love reading Quora & have downloaded it before but it eats up my data. So I deleted it. Now it's requesting to be downloaded again. Maybe I need to stop reading Quora.,negative
"I've been an avid reader for at least a year I believe and have been invited to the writer program but I've started to receive stories from ""former"" writer and honestly after seeing one that had been in my digest I honestly dis-installed the app and I'm very upset as you can see by my rating. No one should have their memories stolen or plagiarized.",negative
"I don't know what's the problem with the developers and care takers of this app , we get updates but not the one which is the need of the hour . "" dark theme or dark mode "" in quora to aid our reading on quora . Its so much troubling and difficult to read when the white light of screen flashes on face and blinds the eyes .

Application too buggy sometimes crash while loading. And now you can't les us use website in android browser too it force us to take back playstore and to use android app while its sucks. Don't force your user to use your application for earning money from in-app ads.,negative
This app is horrible! I used to use the online version witch I loved. But now they are forcing me to get the app! And i dont have anymore space on my phone. QUORA! YOU ARE STUPID!! LET ME USE THE MOBILE VERSION!! I will now delete my quora account.,negative
Please wear your seatbelts while browsing quora because suddenly you will forced to turn to this page. To quora I dont want to install your app. Please let me continue on browser. If it continues (directing to this page) you will have one less user.,negative

"Stop giving me pop ups to install Quora App. I am not gonna do it. I dont want to use your app... it sucks. I want to use web based platform, let me use it. dont irritate me with page blocks and all suggesting to install quora app, because the app sucks and I dont want to use it.",negative
"Good experience using it in web, they ruined that by forcing to download the app and the app is not even close to the web version, bad app",negative
I have had enough of Quora pushing this app on me with ads that block the content I'm trying to read. I've tried this app and prefer reading in Chrome. If these ads keep pushing me I'll simply unsubscribe from Quora entirely!,negative
"Installed this app just to downvote it and give this review. Why Quora is forcing us to migrate to app when our preffered browser works just fine. Either way the app is not upto the mark and takes more time to load content. As if spamming my email was not enough, Quora team has resorted to this nonsense. Please allow content browsing from mobile browser, people can dump quora anytime and migrate to any other site if you force them.",negative
"I love the stories that educate people about different types of people, but I hated that this Q app ad kept popping up in the middle of it several times, everytime I read one.

"Why do you even allow quora to open in mobile browser if you don't even want to users to proceed? Sooo damn irritating! Why do you give the popup to install the app when quora site is opened in mobile browser? And it's okay if you show the popup, bt at least give a close button with it. User must not be forced to do anything. Giving one star because I'm really irritated with that popup. I really want this to reach to the quora team so that they can do something about it. Nothing against the app.",negative
I warn to don't use this app. They are showing many this which are not good for me. The daily digest which the show are also not having that much information,negative
Quora was a good app.with quora we will learn English.. because people will share there stories..story reading will help us to improve English..and it was a pretty good app .with many more stories..,positive
Something gets broken every now and then. Now the upvote button is not working when reading the answer. The same button works in the timeline..,negative
The default keeps taking the app to the local language and there are no easy options to find a way to switch to English. I have spent too long trying to find an answer to this that works.,negative
Only downloaded this app because in Google Chrome it doesn't support after viewing one or two pages. Disgraceful attempt to force people to download this app,negative

"Intriguing! Educative and entertaining! Thank yiu Quora. It went from being intriguing to becoming imposing! Why?! I mustn't install your App Quora. It is annoying and irritating to be shut out and forcefully induced to doing what you are adult enough to not want to do.

"Service is great but app is very poor , it's not user friendly at all, I'm starting use the website",negative
Please have an update with a night mode version. This is a feature which is being adapted by most apps now. More improvements can be made in the user interface.,positive
"Changing my review to 1 star. Quora is trying to force me to download the app every time I start reading my digest from a link in my email. Frankly, I have no need for another app filling up my storage. I shouldn't have to get on my computer to be able to read Quora.",negative
"I don't want the app. I've had to clear space just to be able to make a review saying I do not want this app and I do not appreciate being forced into clearing my page in the middle of my reading because your obnoxious ad with no close button comes up and refuses to go down.

Forcing me to use the APP is just annoying. Im happy with the browser version.,negative
Very nice app Helps one to gain knowledge as well as to share the same.. Make one aware about diffferent topics of his/ her choice.,positive
When I close the app by pressing the back button it still occupies ram. I have to close it by clearing it from recent apps otherwise it wont automatically close. FIX THIS AWFUL BUG,negative
"Takes forever to load each answer, interface is not good. Worked better in the Google Chrome browser on my phone but then quora later changed its policy and insisted to download app for viewing the answers. Terrible. Has discouraged me from using Quora.",negative
"Can you please remove the ""install the app"" title from the website? I don't like your app cause it crashes every time!",negative
"Dear developers, I don't plan on downloading your app because when I view the mobile version of your website, a pop up shows up in the middle of an article that I'm not able to remove. It reads ""Get your digest wherever you go."" The options are ""Download the free app,"" or ""I already have the app."" Neither option allows me to read the article I'm on. And it always shows up in the same spot. If you fix this and allow me to use your website the away I want to, I might be more inclined to download.",negative

The hottest feature that every app should have - DARK MODE - is not supported by this app. Very disappointed‚Ä¶!!!,negative
"Quora forces you to download their app. Options are: 1) download the app 2) i already have the app if you don't have the app and don't want to download it, you'll probably pick option 2... It'll redirect to to Google play store to download. No close button... None. You'll have to download of you want to continue browsing through.",negative
"It lags so much! It's hard to type answers because of how much it lags and crashes. I only use the app to read answers, but I have to use my computer if I ever want to write one.",negative
"When your website provides exact same functionalities and actually has better performance, why should I be forced to download the app? I can't scroll past an answer after which the popup to download the app appears. Actually this kills the user experience, makes me more determined not to use the app and I am spending way less time on Quora than I used to. If you still keep pestering with popup, then this 3 year old Quora user have no choice but to leave.",negative
"Please, dark mode please! Now it's burning the eyes, cannot use the app at bedtime when I have quality attention to learn new things before sleeping... That's frustrating. If dark mode arrives, will raise to 5 stars!",negative

Forcing users to download the app is awfully puerile. Thanks for a great user experience. (That's sarcasm just so you know),positive

This app can't sign-up while I tried more than 20 times despite having stable internet connection.,negative
"5 stars for quora as a whole, but 1 star dor this app- for forcing people to download the app and spoiling the whole fun of reading. Why can't the app be kept as an option? Secondly, the wait of several minutes for the app to download, but no progress (no connectivity issues).",negative
"I really dislike the layout of the phone app. When opening an article I'm interested in, it requires me to click on that article 2 more times before I can actually read it. The newest update doesn't prompt me to read other responses. I want to but can't. I don't want only one opinion. I also dislike having to choose spaces.

Why are you not allowing me to read through web? Always interrupting me to use the damn app? I read an answer and there comes a pop up asking me to download the app with a helicopter sign. It's so irritating. I open Quora digest through a link from Gmail app and then all this nonsense happens. Do something.,negative
Never thought I would say this.. but too many ads and promoted posts is leading to a bad experience. Too many cooks spoil the broth you know. :(,negative
"Only installed because your mobile site forced me to with an unclosable popup ad. If I could give zero stars, I would.",negative

I was forced to download this app when I was browsing their site. I have been reading their site for months and now I had to download this to continue reading,negative
Website kept on forcing me to install the app ... For me it's a waste of memory...

"Dear developers, I don't want to use mobile application because your website is better and also, mobile applications take some space on phone. During quarantine, you MUST understand that many people's phone are working poorly and don't want to increase the load by application. Stop forcing users to use application. I have decreased the use of Quora since you have implemented that popup that cannot be closed and maybe stop using Quora if it continues. Quality of QnA is decreased anyway.",negative
"This app is ridiculous.. they change your question to fit what they want, you have to add info via comment or answer your own question, and then they tell you your real name doesn't meet their standards and have to file a contact form to say that it is your name.

Browser stream sucks ! Add cancel button to pop up advertisement. Quora is good... but not the browser pop up advertisement which keeps on asking to download the app. I have the app but it works better in the browser where i can do other work too. Fix the pop up to atleast have a cancel button !,negative
"The messaging option sucks big time, so much hazzle to open a new dialog to write one quick message",negative
"F you quora F you for forcing people to download your horrible app when the website is so much better, and even then forcing us to use it by making unremovable popups on the website. I'm deleting your app and quitting quora all togethor besides my previous daily usage because it's simply not enjoyable anymore and you've pissed me off. Idk why you hate your users so much but doing this will inevitably lead to the loss of many current mobile users as well as ward off potential mobile users.",negative
I just installed it to give it a rating of 1. This wud be a tight slap on the face of that genious who thought that this way he/she can increase the number of downloads. Uninstalling it now,negative
"App is prone to crash, loss of feed and has a terrible UI. Website version is way better but then again quora forces us to use app after a couple if minutes, adding to existing miseries. Also fix your search!",negative
I did not want to install this app. But you kept interrupting my reading to force me to install it. Now I cant find the article I was in the middle of reading. Congratulations on forcing my hand!!,negative
"Please provide option in app to sort answers by number of upvotes. Instead of option to bookmark answers provide option to bookmark question.Reason for this is we sometimes end up bookmarking answers for same question. In that case, user shall get notification if he tries to bookmark already bookmarked question. P. S. : Still waiting for quora to provide this feature, no response yet",neutral
"The app isn't honouring the font scaling in device settings, and there don't appear to be any settings within the app to adjust font size; appalling accessibility.",negative
When I read article on their site they force to download the apps which is not a good practice. If you force to download the app I will review according to me. It for that...,negative
It's actually good but maybe it would be better if there don't size customization in app so its not hurt eyes when read here. Because basically the articles is long and need large font size to enjoy read it,positive
"Doesnt work in my android phone. Needs a very high figh phone to work properly. Everytime I open it , it shows ""quora is not responding would u like to close it"". Its very disgusting and annoying.",negative
"This is the worst app in my phone always crashes no matter what you do, i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing cache and what not still problem remains the same",negative
We are back to the website being blocked and forcing us to use or download the app. Please stop this. I would pick zero stars if I could. It makes no sense for us users why this is a recurring issue(feature?),negative
"I haven't made a careful comparison between the Quora app and the Quora website on Chrome. In either case, it is loaded with ads and garbage questions, but I believe that's more a function of Quora itself than of the method of accessing it.",negative
An intetesting app with an almost unlimited freedom to express your views even against the establishment. But not unlimited freedom.,neutral
"Great concept! The interface is decent. Not so mobile friendly, but okay.",positive
Unable to update the application properly... as of now.. and it happened already twice... ü§îü•∫,negative

"The website forces you to Install the app for a ""better experience"", however it's just an excuse to download this Garbage. Perhaps not forcing the users to download the app would help to get better reviews, anyway that's all I have to say...",negative
"Quora, what is this new pop up suggesting new spaces when I'm reading an article?????? It is very annoying. I tried to deactivate but I still pops up every 30sec. Please make it stop. Thank you.",negative
The app has a lot of bugs and the fact that the mobile site is really bad gives me no choice but keep using this.,negative
Everything with in the App is Great! The problem is trying to type anything the curser is here and there causes everything to freeze. So irritating!,positive
"I was forced to load the app to read complete responses, but once I did, I only got one story at a time, couldn't back out of that response and get to my feed, and couldn't see whole comment conversations when I responded to a notification that someone had responded to my comment. About 60-70% of the time I cannot like a response. The app will not accept my entry. I am done. If I can't read the entries through my browser on my phone, I won't use Quora any more.",negative
Great app for exploration of emotional / psychological support. Very non-judgemental. Intelligent arguements for the most part.,positive
"I use Quora on my PC browser without any issues, but every time I open a post on a browser on my phone then it forces me to download the app to see the contents which is very annoying!",negative
"1st of all, dark mode is not supported , we can not save or bookmark the article or the page . Briefly, the Quora app is't not as user friendly, as it required .",negative
QUORA has changed my life. I got a opportunity to read a lot of ideas of the learned persons. A fantastic app.,positive
"It's a lovely app and is quite informative. I love that it gives you glimpses, however brief into people's minds, how they think, process ideas, etc. My only complaint is that it loads too slowly even when the network is good",positive
"Very nice question& answer app. Any doubts, any topic, they will b cleared. 90% accuracy.",positive
"Quora is a good app but it's not mobile friendly no more, most of the time it's unreliable now. Hope the team takes care of it ..",negative
"Very difficult , very slow to open in mobile.. Sometimes contain inappropriate photos.. And lot of times , reply is nothing but the porn stories.. I am going to uninstall.",negative
"I have been trying to download the app for the las 90 minutes unsuccessfully, and is not my internet because I downloaded other apps without any problem.",negative
"Really like this social media platform. Lots of good content. This isn't a platform made for debates or connecting with friends, but a top-down question and answer format for consuming content and asking questions.",positive
"When I explore a question, some of the pictures included in them suddenly dissapear along with the profile pictures of the ones who answered them.",neutral
"I think this type of app is best of all. Because this app provide a network between Questions and Answers in the super way i ever have. Guiding,Supporting and Good behaving with each other . Also provide Question choices on every topic of the world. Finding Answers, sequence of math ridals. Such a Osm app.",positive
App version sucks.no option to change text size. Browser forces to use app. (old review for browser version below) Just give it a try. It is able to change your life. You are lucky to see this.,negative
"App is wonderful, informative and answers my lot of questions, thanks to the users. However, the new feature of ""Spaces"" is annoying as it suddenly pops up while reading. Please help to disable it.",positive
"The recent update has ruined the application speed. Now, it has been loading with snail speed.",negative
You all sites are forcing us to download every application. Our phone is not 100TB to download all that apps which we can just browse.,negative
"Very bad experience after the update , it crashes a lot times and uses lots of phone memory.",negative
Quora is awesome but the app is not user friendly. It is awfully slow and is very difficult to write and edit answers. Please look into it asap.,negative
It helped me. But when I search something on its website it hide the content and force to open the content in application. This is not fair for those who are having small internal storage on their device.,negative
"idk why but everytime i try to give my answers some edits, my phone goes lagging and error. it kinda sucks.",negative
Very interesting contents but it always creates a bad experience when I get visiting the both app and website . It is very slow,negative
Can't run in half screen. Always laggy. Who in the world is hell bent on ruining a perfectly good app. Requires more data as compared to previously. Worst updates ever.,negative
"App feel sluggish and slow. The further you scroll the slower the app gets. You can tell that there no proper trash of article you read, as sometimes you see that articles get opened instead of the one you click. Typing or replying is slow. Using s7 edge.",negative
This is stupid recommendation to install app. Even though we are reading some article after logging in over mobile browser why are you forcing users to install app. You are blocking page giving no option to close the window. This is completely unacceptable and it just simply irritates us. It's up to us to install an app or not you should be forcing people to install it without reading the content and providing option to close this.,negative
"App is clean but a little clunky. PLEASE have an option in the setting to disable the ANNOYING pop up saying ""we found spaces for you!"" every time you go to another page. Very annoying. Very annoying. VERY ANNOYING!!!",negative
I have been using it since 4 years. The app is not opening with mobile data. It's not loading the page . But it will open with WiFi. I don't know what is the problem. And my mobile internet work just at good speed. Plz help.....üëç‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇ,negative
This app is not loading once open it is not refreshing and it is really slow to open.,negative
"Whatever framework you guys are using isn't working efficiently, the app is slow, loads content slowly, an easy task like commenting is also slow.",negative
"Quora on desktop is wonderful. But this android app is just a waste of time. May be it is better you remove the app and just keep the web version. It doesnt open from any other app. Gives updates in GMail i subscribe. But wont open. From chrome or any other app it doesnt open at all. And too slow. Sometimes even searching inside the app s slow. The content, moderators are top notch, premium stuff. But the server, software development all sucks. Really lately i am searching alternatives to quora",negative
Reading in browser is better. This is such an inefficient app. Gets very slow after reading for some time. Even freezes my phone. Pls improve.,negative
"I will not download your app. Website is just fine, so don't redirect me again and again... 1 star for your constant intrusion!",negative
It drains a lot of my phone's battery as my phone heats up and i receive pop-ups that's it's been draining the battery.,negative
"Inspite of how i much i try upvoting amd downvoting, i am not able to improve my feed related to my interests. Also in next update i would love to have a night/dark mode.",negative
What a great idea so poorly implemented. This bear of an app sucks the juice and burns silicon. Often times it'll open questions that are not even clicked upon. Don't even get me going about the emails and notifications. It's like a dementia ridden grandma that can only remember your phone number. Uninstalled until a later date.,negative
Keeps sending notification if you know German or other languages....stop with the annoying popups... uninstalling,negative
Often laggy and buggy. Sometimes unresponsive. Frustrating to use.,negative
It keeps recommending me spaces to follow everytime i open a post. Its literally unbearable. I even tried following a couple of communities even though i wasn't interested and it just keeps popping up. Absolutely unusable.,negative
The app is extremely slow. And it doesn't even load every content properly. The website forces you to download the app with a pop up. So there is absolutely no way to read content seamlessly in Mobile phones which is really frustrating.,negative
Interesting questions and experiences but the constant pop ups are beyond annoying. Definitely 1 star,negative
"This app has become soo much slower then what it was used to be, now if you click on something you want to read it usually take soo much of time and also will load two or three instances of the same just fed of this, yet I continue using this",negative
"No I don't want to install the app, I'd like to use my browser to view quora, so please remove that banner preventing me to continue browsing quora on my browser and forcing me to install the app.",negative
"Because Quora won't let me use mobile website with the ¬æ page covered with banner asking to install the app, I relented and did install. But, it's a shame that this app doesn't have dark mode. üëé",negative
"Quora is all about typing and writing, how can such an app have terrible bugs in it's core purpose. I don't know if it's because I'm using a different keyboard app or something, but when you're writing long replies to questions there's some very weird bugs going around that not only make me lose time because I spend most of it trying to figure a way to edit or change my words properly, but also my patience. I'm uninstalling, I'd rather use Quora on a computer stress-free.",negative
"In the past the content used to be very good , but nowadays it is full of useless questions.",negative
It's a great app which can make you its adicted (but for your learning). I really love this app. I have learned a lot of from it which I could never learn from my school also. I have no problems from this app. I am really thankful to its developer and Quora.inc who owned it.,positive
I love quora but app user experience is not that great.inspite it mostly on text it still requires more data speed.. please update so that it can run on low speed as well...,negative
Request you to please add dark mode or dark theme options. On Amoled screen reading on white is too bright hurting the eyes.,negative
I really like quora. But I really do not like the way quora compel me to use their app. This app needs much improvement.,negative
It takes to open. It takes time to load pictures. Please fix this issue. Otherwise it's a great app.,negative
3rd grade app. Always asking fir login and wastes time. They force you to install app everytime.this is not good if I had to read only 2-3 articles why should I be forced to have an app,negative
Its almost impossible to write answers on here. The constant glitching and when you try to edit the text randomly moves. Or a word that you were tying to change magically moves to the end of the sentence. Its a huge headache for writers. These issues are killing the app for me.,negative
Have been using this app for about 5 years. Earlier the application was stable and breeze to use. Now it's become pathetic and hopelessly unstable crashing every now and then,negative
Worst app. Not loading contents and search not working. Took so long to search but still results not delivered.,negative
"this is a great app really! it is changing my behaviour the way i think completely, really i request to download this app.",positive
Even for registered users: They won't let you read further on website after certain point and insist on installing their app. That's a totally pathetic user experience.,negative
"REVIEW AS OF 10/05/2020: Mods of Quora need an overhaul. REVIEW AS OF 23/02/2018: Very interesting and mentally stimulating (mostly in a good way). You get to chat with intelligent strangers you couldn't have otherwise in other social media apps. Easy to find people of similar wavelength here, and you can engage peacefully in a detached manner. Wit galore. Careful now: it can also keep you up with untimely inspirations to answer random questions of interests. Writers and readers beware! ;)",positive
Adultery content is over-whelming than my personal and followed content. Ads and top picks are good but only content in the feed is very disappointing... This app sucks.,negative
I have been using this app from almost 2 years & its a great platform to improvise your writing skills & learn from others humour.,positive
"A must have for me. Quora is my favorite website. Though this app needs improvement, I will recommend it. This app is worth your time. At least better than social medias. I've learnt a lot from here. A great initiative and a community of great people's.",positive
"The best in terms of ideology but very much need best features to make viewers explore the best feature.. The trending topics need good UI, people need to get updated about the questions whichever is asked on theie favourite topics.. Performance is very low when it is compared as an app",positive
"Buggy, glitchy bad changes made. Man u suck. Just like every other potentially genuine website, this too is gonna trash itself.",negative
Confusing interface. Had to go through every setting individually to switch off email notifications! üò†,negative
"One of the worst app i ever use. I was using quora since 2017 and found it one of the low class app where people can do anything with your answer whatever they want to do. I wrote many answers there about my personal experiences and knowledge and since after the answer it was always marked as ""answer needs attribution"" i mean how can someone's personal experience marked as plagiarism and there is no policy in quora to find that why you answer is reported as plagiarism. Quora is just a timewaste.",negative
"They said my account is blocked from editing for not following their policy and formatting guidelines, but I can't find where to follow them at and they didn't lead me to where I can follow them.......other than that I would say it's a good solid 5.",negative
Update 10th May 2020. App's search bar crashes a lot. --- The editing interface freezes once in a while and it doesn't even store the answer I had written till then in drafts. Please correct that.,negative
"The app itself could have been great but moderation is terrible. I got banned for using ""fake name"" even though it was my real name and I can't use it ever since even though I changed my name.",negative
"It's not the site I have issues with, persay. It's the forcing me to download the app to read something. I was perfectly content using my browser.",negative
Had to download just to look at website. I will now avoid your website like the plague because of this. Other Q&A sites work better anyways.,negative
great app i love giving answers the only problem is it asks for our own experience and only allows us a short description. Just get rid of that feature if we wanna share how we know such then we will provide volunteeringly,positive
I use to love your website until you decided to forcibly reroute mobile users to your app instead of just letting us continue reading on the internet. As helpful as quora is im never clicking on your website for answers even again. Should've just left it the same and continued letting us use the internet instead of shoving your app down our throats.,negative
Quora forces mobile members to use their app through an annoying popup on their mobile site that cannot be closed or bypassed in any manner other than reloading Quora until it happens again.,negative
"Android version of Quora is good if you only want to read other people's answers or write short answers of your own. It falls short when writing a long answer, though. The keyboard starts disappearing and reappearing, the cursor jumps around, and the lag gets worse and worse until it crashes, sometimes crashing the whole phone. Uninstalling & going back to using the Web version.",negative
One of the best of app I have ever came across. But I suggest to add the night mode in the app to consume the app in night also.,positive
This site is hot and cold. The strength is answers to some really odd but interesting questions. I would have rated higher as most answers are drawn from people with some knowledge on the topic at hand. I down grade the site because of the articles on politics. I am a proud Independent and base my voting decisions on what I understand to be relevant facts. What I read shows bias based on political affiliation with little knowledge value added. Disappointing.,negative
Quora is great; the app is disappointing. The app is slow. Keeps crashing when I write an answer and my phone screen gets locked.,negative
I love this app. I recently got rid of a narcissist and this app. has professional people and also people that have been in a similar situation. I have learned so much. Very informative. Thanks,positive
"I uninstalled this good app recently. Topics are great and helpful, however, I'm using my very own data. This app doesn't have a ""save for offline reading"" button which is utterly one of the reason why I was very disappointed. I hope you guys reckon why refreshing topics all the time are very inefficient for data users.",negative
This is really a great app but now a days it crashes a lot. I recently update this app but still this app crashes a lot.,negative
"I'm uninstalling this because it doesn't have a dark mode, on the other hand, there's no other way to change one's profile photo",negative
"This app is a good platform for every person. Here we can ask any question. As I am a student i found it very useful to me. There are many IITians, NITians also who helped me during the preparation of IIT-JEE & I have also become an NITian. But sometimes the app hangs my phone. But still this is one of the best app for knowledge.",positive
"Trash, first of all i went to see a question from their website but then it told me i have to login to see it pissed me off then i logged in and after i login then i have to download the app to review any questions. This is an absolute trash experience and i probably will never use it again",negative
"I love website more but they have business to do, and because of that i am forced to download it. Worst experience.",negative
I uninstalled the app so that no one forces me to open the app with tue excuse to get full experience. Edit 1 Now on chrome mobile also you force to download. I started to use adblock browser with desktop mode. If this is what you want so be it. I also started to ask my friends to do the same.,neutral
"Quora is best social platform.But the application is very slow, hangout and crash many times. Otherwise it's a good concept.",negative
"Its one of my favorite apps. I spend hours at times on Quora. It gives me insight on people's minds, thinking, trends.",positive
"Too many notifications about every irrelevant activity have got over the clutter-free experience. Still, app has not lost its relevance for learners.",neutral
My Quora does not change to potrait mode when I set my phone in potrait mode. Make changes about this. It is really annoying.,negative
This app is really good I have only asked a few questions and got some good answers this is really helpful especially whith questions about mental health and things that you are concerned or confused about,positive
The app is not at all working for any of my search. If I search in my mobile browser it forces me to use the app which wont work. Please dont make it compulsory to use the app.,negative
literally just wanted to read one article but then forced me to download the app and then select on different topics and when I selected topics would not let me proceed what kind of idiot made this app,negative
There is some problem in the app.it doesnt show feed.it neither allows me to add posts.it always appears that tbere is something wrong.please do away with the issue as im unable to use the app.,negative
"One of the useless app I've ever seen, why can't the author allow us to continue enjoying the provided articles on their website? Now you must download this app before you read anything on their website, very selfish moderators.üôÅ",negative
You keep insisting people to download the app. It's irritating. I simply don't want to use your app. Not needed. Thank you. P.S. Don't force people anything.,negative
"App runs very slowly. If I Google a question with *Quora* suffix, I will get a link and it opens quickly in the App compared to that if I directly type the question in App itself. Moderator may please look into this issue. If any clarity needed on my feedback comment please.",neutral
Waow! What a wonderful app is Quota? I get solutions to my petty petty mathematics problems here. I recommend it to you to use and you will never regret you did.,positive
"I cant login with my email accout. Once I enter the credentials,it says Unable to contact server.try again later..",negative
I am disappointed with you bcz firstly you are saying us to just login through Google and after that still u don't show us the article which I wanna see instead you are saying to download app this is not good thing....,negative
Please fix the bug when i click to read more ...it goes up and again the click more button is there and the loop continues.,negative
"The new updates are bad. The font shouldn't have changed. Also it takes more time to load the answers now. The default profile picture is bad, I liked the earlier one more.",negative
Bug Filled App. Poor Customer Support. Quora has only progressed (backwards) in all these years. Highly disappointed.,negative
App is good. Useful too but needs lots of improvements. Very Slow.,positive
"More like if Yahoo answers and reddit had a baby. You can find most of the answers you are looking for and request an answer from users if it's a new topic. The only gripe I have are th constant notification about ""trending"" or ""interesting/hot"" topics... I have it switched on to get similar questions and answers...didn't expect these many notifications",neutral
Earlier it was a great app. But now I really don't know what's wrong but my digest refuses to load it always shows a blank screen.,negative
"The app rarely ever works. Almost every time I use the app, the screen will go blank and I'll get an error message. It's really irritating to no end, please put some care into your app.",negative
Pretty good app but my feed was just full of British dudes self congratulating themselves for being british but my biggest takeaway from the app was that everyone on there feels like they know more than you on about anything and everything. UI is clunky and slow and ads are extremely misleading.,negative
"The app needs an improved UI and there are some redundancies, cluttering ,fix it and above all please add DARK MODE, it is a place where you spend a lot of time , its best for the viewing experience.",neutral
"Display area and interactive area constantly out if sync. Will often: open advertisements that are no longer on screen, ""follow"" questions that are no longer on screen, etc.",neutral
Worst user interface ever. And it's annoying they force you to use the app. You hardly get answers either. Use Reddit instead. It kills this lame ugly annoying app.,negative
You should allow user to explore quora through mobile site too and not force the user to install the app for more browsing. It's very annoying. üíØ downvotes.,negative
"It's a good app but whenever i want to search anything on it using web it always forces ke to use the app, and I don't want to use the app.",negative

"What the hell is this!! I cannot answer, I cannot upvote, I cannot share, Why?? When I click on upvote button it shows upvote and suddenly disappeare, leaving upvote icon blank. This is very serious issue. Please do work for it or else you are trying to decrease the reputation of this app and users as well.",negative
"This app is worse than worthless. Their service is beyond scummy and sleazy, their app hardly works and has a painful-to-view user interface, and is just generally of poor quality. I wouldn't recommend Quora if they had paid me to. Honestly I would just stick with Reddit.",negative
App is the worst. Thw website is the perfect one but it keeps u forcing to download the app.,negative
"I was an early user of Quora. I really enjoyed using it back then. After multiple updates, I know not how to use Quora anymore. That's so damn sad ! The UX became terrible. I don't even know how they categorize things inside the app. I'm really sad for such a great concept put on such a terrible app. But yeah thanks for the good old days.",negative
"Worst application ever. Whenever I search om Google, and click on suggested quora answers link, application gets opened but even after so many minute, it hardly shows anything, and only blank white screen is seen.

There's a need of Huge UI modification on app. dark mode and many more. this is essential for the future of quora. hope you will read this.,positive
It has gone so bad lately that I hate opening the app. Useless ad that covers most of the content. New updates that makes the app much more unappealing. The suggestion is some so disgusting that I will not describe. Don't download the app.,negative
"For forcing me to download app by redirecting towards here, instead of allowing me to browse your site in a browser..!!!",negative

"Very good and really it focus in all basic needs for a life.We have many doubts even having knowledge. This app everyday brings different prospects in brief but very informative.

Most good app. Thank you team members.",positive
This app gave me a terrible user experience. Its always slow when loading content especially images and it even crashes my Nokia 2 phone. Please Guys just redesign the app bcoz this one is terrible.,negative
Too forceful. Only downloading the app cause you have too else it won't let you view content. Not including the annoyance of registration.,negative

I don't like being forced to download an app in order to get rid of a pop up and continue reading an answer. FCUK U,negative
I give 5 star only for content but app speed is too slow. It takes long time to process any request. Just with white page only have to wait for nexr processing. It should be increased other wise i will remove it from my phone. I know you do not worry about my deletion but you should know one ant can defeat an elephant.,negative
"You are forcing people to sign un and download your app from your website, and thats wrong maybe I just want to know about one question or maybe your app isn't compatible with my mobile, I recommend people use wikihow, yahoo or maybe something else.",negative
Everything is good but one thing is in the need is dark mode. Ensure dark mode in the app so that no strain n stress occur in eyes.,positive

So embarrasing that the webpage on cellphone doesn't let reading and forces installing the app. Extremely dissappointing..,negative
"Nowadays , Quora is not what it used to be. It has become an alternative for instagram posts as most of the screenshot content is from instagram. I don't know who are the people who asks ""what are the best screenshots in your phone?"". Aren't they fed up of it.",negative
* Infinite loading time irrespective of internet *Scrolling just stops working so stuck at the top of the page *Crashes occasionally All of this makes it pretty much impossible to use it most of the time. It's an otherwise decent app. Im sure a lot of us would appreciate it if the devs fix this stuff asap.,negative
"Its been 3 years since I am using Quora and now the app has started to lag, takes a lot of time to load, behave weirdly with late tap response with different output than expected, all of this reasons has led me to hate this app but I can't leave Quora and switched to desktop version. please launch a simple, smooth app because the present version is clearly horrible. I wrote a review previously as well but didn't received any reply. what's more surprising is how Quora dev team can overlook such terrible performance of this app. please, please do the needful. !!!!",negative

"Super Buggy; My feed only shows one post at a time and it says ""Something went wrong"" after that single post so I have to refresh to view the next one. Furthermore when that isn't a problem the app is Buggy when scrolling and clicking sometimes going to the wrong post when I click something. Can't report problems in app either since it says I'm not connected to the internet.",negative
You are not allowing people to use Quora without app. Forcing users to use app. But you app is 3rd class and it is more pathetic. Only getting white screen waiting to load on ur app. You should atleast respect user's freedom. Why you are not allowing users to use web version when you don't have capability to resolve app issues.,negative
"It's wonderful and interesting, but I think it needs few updates.             While answering a question I wanted to save it as a draft for future editing.... instead it kept loading for a few minutes only to be redirected back to the same page. I thought it had been saved and closed the app only to find out later that nothing has been saved.",positive
Worst interface. Very slow in loading content. Everything feels like a mess. Inconsistent design. The website works fine that this app,negative
"Not so good, when I was reading a answer of question, and after 30 screen goes off, but when I turn my screen on, that topic has been gone from the screen and Quora has started from startover, this is totally annoying me.",negative
"Quora is no new app that needs my review for others to see. It's very good just one problem though. It could have a feature for people who write answers to mark their answers as ""NOT SAFE FOR WORK"", etc. like reddit in case the answer has some graphic , mature etc. content. Devs, can you consider my opinion?",positive
My kind of time pass! But honestly I hate reading long answers. Some of them just bore us. I think quota should have a word limit too!,negative
"This is probably the best app to use if you want to get smarter üòâ. Big thumbs up! Wish I could give it more than a 5-Star review. However, if the developers of the app could let users save images it would be a lot easier and better to use.",positive
"Its a fine app...until you want to write and post an answer or comment. Posting on any other site is like going to a grocery store and paying normally at the check out line. Posting on Quora is like going to a grocery store where the store clerk is an ESL, senile, brain damaged one armed Parkinsons afflicted man that constantly drops your groceries on the floor when scanning and/or bagging them and can barely run a register or debit machine at all and who cannot understand anything you say.",neutral
The app crashes too often these days. Every now and then the error 504 shows up which is very annoying. Needs to be fixed.,negative
Why can't I use the website. I'm on 3g so can't download app. All I wanted to do was read one webpage. What about if no space left? Forcing me to do anything is not a good start to any relationship,negative
"I love you Quora & folk great app, don't tell Google I like you better. I just wish you were easier to navigate for me. Thanks for the time you all put into making this informative and I hope accurate information.",positive
"Forced install. Even tho there is a website, Quora allows you a brief minute to read the article on their site before popping up with the option to open their app to finish reading or to install it to finish reading. I dont appreciate being forced to install an app to read articles that appear on a website.",negative
Extremely poor experience! This app keeps crashing and my answers keep disappearing on their own while I type/submit the answer/post. Please fix it asap.,negative
"Mobile and web app is not loading showing ""something went wrong"". Since 2 days",negative
"It's been 2 days since the last usage of the app, I can't open the app while all internet connections are available and in good connections. 2 star till you guys fix this.",negative
"Just realized that browser version is much faster than this app, but browser version keep told me to use the app thought it's slower",neutral
Quora is such a productive platform which boostes our enthusiasm to be a better version of ourselves. Personally it helps me to stay away from demotivating social media!,positive
"Despite being a very useful app ,I would say its quality and speed has been worsened a lot. It take a lot of time to open ,load and all. I would request the company to overcome with these flaws in the application.",negative
"You are useless piece of shi* ! Firstly you made mandatory to have it on mobile phone to browse the site, it almost worthless to keep this app which is used 2-3 times a month. And now you're not allowing to open the page unless I update app ? Really ? Uninstalling it üñï",negative
"Why doesnt quora let me read in my browser. Whenever im reading some interesting piece, comes a ugly pop up recomending me to read in app. It irritates me to the core. I dont want to install your app. Pl let me read in my browser otherwise there are other sources for me to check out.",negative
"I m giving quora only 4 star, although it is very best app gives lots of information and also help to sort out our study related routine problems..but still quora app dont answer my question which i asked 5 days befor. So i m only give 4 stars",negative
"These days Quora app is not performing upto the minimum required mark. The loading of content , pictures,pages became very slow despite fast internet.",negative
Worst app I ever seen.. I can't use the app.. Loading.. Loading.. Still loading only.. If I use the web browser it will ask to open the page app.. What I will do? Worst one.,negative
Still the worst app....keeps hanging like a hell and very frustating to use this app...none of the updates are solvkng the issue,negative
"Kindly introduce dark mode as soon as possible.Now a days most of the apps has this feature.Youtube ,whatsapp .Even the playstore itself has.",neutral
"This app used to be great until the recent update. It's so slow and takes forever to load pictures only to write ""sorry, something went wrong"" after a whole 10 minutes.",negative
I love to use quora as it will keep me up to date. App is taking long time to open and update on 4G network.,positive
Quora is one of the best platform to gain knowledge and for sharing information. It is multilingual. You can find variety of solutions to your problem!,positive
"Worst, images in most of the answers do not load on time. Answers with images always do not load properly. Failed to load images notification irritates too much.",negative
"I'm really impressed. I'm sure that if you keep working a bit on it, you can make it the slowest, less responsive app on the market.",positive
This is the best social platform anyone could ever find. The information and materials presented here are life changing. I highly recommend it.,positive
Very good source of knowledge. You can ask questions and read some brilliant answers from brilliant people.,positive
Wow it is really wonderful app. You can ask questions that you cant ask your friends or family because you're embarrassed or scared. With this app you can communicate with people who has the same problem or interest like you. I will give it 5 stars because it's just that amazing app that hard to find anywhere else.,positive
"Keyboard formatting is buggy, double-typing characters when toggling bold or italics online. Cannot insert hyperlinks into selected text, but only footnotes. Worst of all, Quora forces regular users to use the app on a mobile device with no regard for their personal preference to use a web browser instead.",negative
"Totally useless for me. URLs received in email don't load in app. When trying access in browser, it forces me open in app after reading one answer. So, I am stuck and the app is totally useless for me. @Quora Please resolve the issues.",negative
"When you open a post,there is always that same annoying popup asking if i know French. The response should be flagged once and that's the end of story. What's the use of repeatedly annoy with the same exact pop question everytime you open a post. This is ultra annoying.",negative
"I'll go straight to the point. I've been blocked, for some reasons, and even after reading the rules of the app I still don't understand what I've done. Anyways, the rules are dumb and some of them have no reason to be there. For example, you are blocked if you don't put your real full name(that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life but ok), if you write an answer that was suppose to be a comment, if you post a meme or a joke, if you write in any other language than English, etc.",negative
"Never better than a 2, they've done something in the last day to knock a star off even that! The concept is good, the execution is awful.",negative
"Just to use the site over google, you need an account and it will not stop bugging you until you make an account for it. Ok! Account made, now i can finally use it! Nope! Now we want you to download our app in the playstore!",neutral
I am currently working in Middle East and I don't know a single word Arabic but whem I download this app it appears in Arabic amd i have no idea how to handle it. If i download it in Middle east it doesn't mean that I know Arabic language. I hate when i enter websites but it shows up in a language that i don't understand.,negative
"Its very educative in the sense that u find every answers u find if not all but few, just want them to add more features in d next update.",positive
I specially came here to give one star to such great app b'coz of the screen view around 20% is cover with upvote etc options next 10% above with details of publishers and again 20% with group details soo worse i can't even see the whole photo published in answers really need improvement!!!!,negative
Quora app is getting slower day by day. Cant even open it properly and the battery is heating up after using quora app. Even while writing a long answer quora stop responding.,negative
One of the best APP i have ever meet.it have almost all the answers you are looking for about your life and universe. Thanks to the developer.üôè,positive
"Out of topic and full of garbage, but has the audacity to force you to use its mobile app. Better go to StackExchange",negative
"Very very bad ,you will get notifications but it won't open up.so horrible and not much useful app.if there is an option of 0 rating it will give that.its my opinion.",negative
"Quora is a good app but I'd like to draw attention of the developers regarding one thing. The speed of the app is not good enough. While others app can be used even in low to medium internet speeds, Quora doesn't load properly sometimes even with good internet speed. Please look into this matter.",negative
Always forcing to make an update otherwise it's not letting me use. Wow really? Take the 1 star then. Its annoying. I repeat its annoying,negative
"Plz add a dark mode, this app is extremely helpful, just don't want to strain my eyes.",positive

"The experience used to be SO MUCH better. Now the app is slow, answers cannot be viewed well (max. 1 at a time) and even the posting process is laggy",negative
Really not good there is some problem with the app it is too slow to render one to quit . Kindly look into this matter,negative
Moderation need work otherwise its good. User interface need update. I will update my ratings once problem is rectified.,neutral
"The app never works. It's slow, and mostly just keeps crashing.",negative
"Extremely interactive and productively efficient project. Spaces accordingly enable avid users to interact with the software proficiently, thus achieving the motive of the system, gaining knowledge from queries, in a quorum",positive
"It's a pretty cool app, I like how you can reach out to people for answers and stay Anynomous. However, I don't like that you can't type long questions, thats a bummer for me.",positive
"I use this app for learning, fun, great ideas and information! Love it so far!!!,",positive
"Content ia good but Very very slow app, freezes a lot. It doesnt allow to read from browser and asks to use the app only",negative
"Why not dark mode is implemented till now, this app is not usuable at night just because of high whitish it looks. Update: changing 2 stars to 5 stars. Dark mode has been implemented",negative
Slow as a snail. Taking too much time in loading answer. App works like as if I am opening it using a 2G network.,negative
Its extremely slow. The page doesn't load waiting for hours. Please do something.,negative
Months ago Quora app was doing great and I was Loving it but from last month it is as slow as 2G internet connection with no Network . Humble request to developers please make sure that Quora becomes fast again . Please .,negative
Installed purely to tell you that your insufferable pop-up telling me to install this app just means I won't be using your website at all. You might want to rethink that.,negative
This app freezes up a lot and when I'm trying to send an answer/response whether long or short it just makes me very upset my keyboard ends up freezing and then everything just get glitchy. It's making it very difficult to keep tolerating this app. I throughly enjoy it. But you need to fix this problem. I wouldn't delete the app. But I'd continue to make this aware because it's very frustrating. Hopefully it's just my phone.,negative
Great application for those who love reading and writing skills..,positive
"The UI needs to be better. Plus, please add a dark mode as soon as possible!",positive
Very slow app..it was fine searching for answers in website before ..but now after showing few answers and when we try to load more then it directs us to install the app..very bad experience,negative
"I hate that you force a person to have the app to read answered questions. Sure I can read one or two without the app, but eventually you throw up a pop-up that's impassable that won't let the user view an answer, usually when it's a good one they found. I don't want another app on my phone just to read a F'in website! You guys suck.",negative
Its the best. But app suddenly crash when writing answers. All the other things are great,positive
I'd been trying to update the app since forever. It'll download and yet not get installed.,negative
Too slow.. and despite turning off notifications..they keep sending it constantly,negative
"It's indeed a good generous way to feel connected through queries, insights and experiences. Just feel the UI too congested to follow through segments. It can be improved to make it more easy going through.",positive
"STOP FORCING ME TO USE THE APP! I don't like the app, I like using Google Chrome to visit the website. You think its not forcing but I can't do anything on the website when the App Advertisement pops on the screen then lose the answer I was reading. Those are shameful tactics.",negative
"Content is great, the app itself is annoying af, it opens articles that you did not tap. EVERYTIME you open an article a annoying window is popping up. You might wanna open an certain article and it's gonna get you back on a page you were reading 10 minutes ago. The app it's making hard for you to enjoy it's content, when 50% of the time you're closing irrelevant pages.",negative
"This is the platform that is really helpful for people to connect with each other, help each other, teach each other about anything, share their views. Love being here.",positive
"No option to delete question, Remove question from your feed (or timeline whatever) even after unfollowing it's still there, no option to delete conversation. Not user friendly.",negative
Finally a meaningful app for everyone. Note that answering question works better on dekstop than app. It lags via app.,positive
Warning! You could get lost in the app. Lots of knowledge. Would rate it five stars if it have a dark theme. -------------------------- Finally. Dark theme arrived. 5 stars it is.,neutral
I loved the idea at first. Getting to talk to people about different ideas sounded great. It quickly became evident that it was not so great. The two most divisive topics are politics and religion. The politics section is overrun with MAGA trolls. QAll the religions are in one section so the Christians keep coming to the Wicca questions. Sometimes I have to look at the context of the the question but I have a hard time finding follow up information. Quora seems to like this divisiveness.,negative
"Pathetic. Using the web application forces you to install the app and hides the QnA. I do not want to install an app that I do not want to. I would read way more articles on the web if it let you, but their forcive nature just pisses people off. Horrible customer experience.",negative
"Dark mode stopped working, I think they removed it. Why? It was the best dark mode implementation I found in any Android app. Can't find a way to turn it on again.",negative
In this app you are not added Gujarati language so please improve your app and added Gujarati language. Because I want My Mother tongue. üôè,neutral
"The content at one time (both questions and answers ) used to be good , but now its mostly thrash. The suggestions it gives are thrash and after spending an hour you will guarantee look back thinking that you could have easily done something better",negative
Add night mode please. Add data saving mode where we get to choose to load low quality images so it saves time to load. It'll be more perfect.,positive
"Okay I downloaded this app just to say that it's not right to just force someone to Install an app. Within 5 minutes on the site, there were like 4-5 popups and this is absolutely not right. People here search for information, most of them under deadline or some totally intrigued in it. And then the pop up to install the app just keeps coming again and again. Not an honourable way to advertise.",negative
I really like this app. My only problem is that sometimes the upvoye button will not work. Also I had dark mode on but now it turned off and I do not know how to turn it back on.,positive
"At times when you open the app, it's just a blank screen. This happens often",neutral
"Hogs battery rapidly even on Android 10, heats up the phone. Good content, waste Play Store app.",positive
Very helpful content but ... Very slow loading ... Students can't search word meanings with just single tap which was possible in browser(google chrome).... This a huge problem for all millions of Quora users ....U must correct this ... Thanks,negative
"Just keeps jumping about. I kept losing the thread i was REALLY wanting to know about. Never did get there in the end. So thought, duck it!",negative
This app is real good to gain knowledge as it inducts in you the curiosity to explore new things and new views and even express yours one too... Amazing app ..I just love it. I too am a proud Quoran.,positive
"These idiots cant even make an app that functions correctly. Anytime I click on anything in Quora, it redirects me to the website page in Chrome. Then, when I go click on something it sends me back to the app. What kind of nonsense is this? How f-in hard is it to make a functioning app. Not only is the typing egregious, but now throw this nonsense on top. Im done.",negative
"Though the app is good It literally sucksüòñ It always opens my account in browser,, wats the use of installing this app when i can open it through browser.",negative
Good app. But it takes some time to msg someone . And it opens another answer if i select another answer.,neutral
"Why have i downloaded this friggin app for again? 'Cause you forced me. You keep on begging me to. And when i finally do it, dang, you b* a* opens a ""read more"" into chrome. Why da fluke have i downloaded this app for???",negative
I have been enjoying this app until the recent update. I noticed the dark mode option disappeared. Why is that?,negative
"I am comfortable with operating quora on a browser and not this app.Why? B'cause, I don't use this app often and I don't require it on my device for more than that required Period of time. And sometimes my device doesn't have enough space and hence I have to uninstall it. I absolutely hate the fact That it forces you to download/ use the app. Please make the website as it used to be or else I might have to stop using this site altogether. Because in the entire process, my purpose is lost.",negative
The moderation team is extremely politically left- facing and collapse all right- leaning answers. Besides that the app is decent.,negative
"The community here is much smarter than the community of instagram. It's fun getting to know people's real life experiences, not watching CRINGE TIKTOK videos, and people helps each other out too. Well, sometimes, but even a text that they support means a lot. 10X better than social media platforms.",positive
After months of use now it asked me to log in. I have no patience to remember the password. Uninstalled and good riddance.,negative
Thank you for adding the dark mode fearure :) Just an idea: Please bring the hide photos feature in the homepage. Most of the photos and videos are added just to grab the attention and I have to scroll more and more to skip a question. They should be shown only when we click on read more.,neutral
Please add night mode for effective reading . It's sorted. Thanks.,positive
"Worst app ever.. ü§Æ it doesn't open at all in the app. Second, I tried uploading pictures on quora from chrome for 5 hrs but everytime it shows operation failed due to low memory. Such a horrible app... I want to give negative 5 but since there is no negative I had to give one star. Fourth grade app! Uploading pictures are most tough works on quora.",negative

"Sorry, this app is fail from Quora!!! I never wanted to use this app but if I use Quora on the browser (chrome), it automatically takes me on this app as soon as i click on the questions or on my profile etc. Needs serious improvement!!! Slow compared to all the browers out there. Like it kind of takes forever to open a particular page. Lacking some features like... Can't copy the links of questions (in browser we can) & more. Can't include more in this review due to the words limit.",negative
It's a cool app in General just to read answers. But horrible when you want to type them. I hate that you forced everyone to install the app when the mobile website version was great!,negative

The best app to show your knowledge and get to knowledge. If you have a hobby to write quora is the best platform for you.,positive
I wanted to give it more stars but the fact that Quora wants me to install the app and use it is not very feasible for me. The thing is I don't have enough space in my phone and therefore I can't install any apps in it. Please help.,negative
The app keeps crashing after 30 min of use. This is happening consistently with me recently,negative
Slowest app award goes to this app... i am not able to read anything as its always showing your loading cards. P.S. I have a great internet speed.,negative
Dark mode has FINALLY been incorporated into the app and for that I am VERY thankful! Fantastic service and flawless app.,positive
"Why dont You just create a simple , fast app. With less attention to graphics. Its the slowest app ever",negative
Very insightful and informative. One gets to learn alot from the shared knowledge that this platform offers. Highly recommended to all.,positive
"The main flaw for me is the sluggishness of comment area, where I have to wait up to 3 minutes often so I can write another word. I don't think it's due to the limitation of my hardware. When I was writing the comment with the browser I never had such issue. I'm taking another star away for forcing me to install Quora app with the pop up at your site when I'm viewing it with my mobile browser. My choices were either install the app, else not be able to finish the material I was reading.",negative

Wow this app is done and dusted. The screen doesn't even show anything and it just keep loading the content.,negative
"I love reading on quora, its like an addiction, but the app is very poorly performing, gets hanged for infinite, pictures never opened, takes a lot of time opening the Q&A. Team need to work more on performance.",negative
Forced me to download app cuz won't open full pages in built browser and constantly bugging me to download. Not everyone has a lot of memory to spare for application that are non essential. Quora in itself is a good place for QnA but this forceful redirection towards this app is ridiculously stupid. üòï,negative
They added dark mode. That's amazing. Now all that's left is a landscape mode and it'll be the app I use all day,positive

I don't like my phone being bloated with dozens of apps, and if they feel that everyone needs to use the app, they should do away with the web version. Makes me wonder if they are harvesting data.",negative

"I understand you want people to download the app when using phones, but I seriously hate it when all I need is just read things through Google Chrome. Don't shove the app on people reading articles/stories online. I even logged in using Google so using chrome should be enough. I prefer reading through browser! And that should be enough. Fix your website and don't redirect or force people to make them download the app.",negative
"I absolutely love this app. I enjoy assisting people with the knowledge that I have from my experience as well as seeking knowledge from others. The cons: Some of the users are awfully nasty! For instance, it's not they are just nasty with you, they are just a nasty person period! Don't engage with them. It's obvious all their answers are like that.",positive
I love this app but sometimes the app open to get time 10 minutes.this was very disappointed to me.,negative

I love this app. It has issues sometimes but the Quora staff are very helpful and generally resolve the issue shortly after its reported.,positive
Quora is the GREATEST. But app is annoying asf. It just load in hours. Any page I click is a blank page for ever. If you want full ratings please fix this asap and reply me.,negative
All the time app is not opening. Kepp loading everytime.. browser is best for this,negative
I can't type a single comment because the app is horribly broken as far as editing yourself without completely retyping half your 60 word story/comment/reply because you can't move your cursor back without the app going apeshit and doing things you in no way told it to do.,negative

I can't look up topics and get everything on them. I don't know if there are any comments. Etc. You get the point. It needs a much better interface, it's not very user friendly...

Every app has some pros and cons but i'm pretty sure that if it is used efficiently then you can gain much knowledge about everything.,positive
"It's best platform for youth of our country ( India ) and our world to get knowledge about almost everything , writing your thoughts and sharing your thought processes . It helps in interacting with some sensible and mature people of this planet . Once you start using it you'll realise that you love studying and gaining knowledge but in the way of quora",positive
"In the latest update, many a times the app doesn't load content if opening from an external link(when the open in app button is pressed, quora keeps loading forever).",negative
Great content but this app is very slow. Loading an answer takes a good 4-5 seconds..,negative
I just want to read on the web. No one will be even visiting the web anymore if you keep forcing them to use the app instead.,negative
"The strategy you use to make people download your app by harassing those who are accessing Quora via their browsers by using constant pop-ups is horrible to say the least. The app doesn't even offer anything important to the user which the browser doesn't, which might have validated installing it. Disappointing.",negative
"I highly recommend readers to install this application. This app is absolutely informative, knowledgeable and very essential. I really like it because this app has played major role to improve my weaknesses in English. I just wanna say thanks to The Developer.",positive
I really like QA but most of the questions are related to China. For those who take the time to answer the questions l really want to thank them for doing a good job with so much detail and very less propaganda.,positive

Don't like the fact that I can almost no longer read from your site in my internet browser. You force me to download the app else I cannot read the full items and I think that's really not great.,negative
Great app but not able to upload photos.. Taking too much time to open even in high internet speed.,negative
"Only downloading this because the web experience is unnecessarily filled with prompts to download the app, to the extent of preventing access to content. A very bad start.",negative
This app is just wow... anything and at any time you ask you'll get your answers. But one thing about this app is that it is a bit laggy & the phone gets slightly heated. The content loading is also quite slow as compared to other apps. Hope this will be fixed soon.,positive
"I don't want this app. I am happy to go to their site and subject myself to advertising but they have it so you get booted off the site and your reading gets permanently interrupted to get the app. Not interested, and it's a shame. It ruins a perfectly good user experience.",negative
"This app is just annoying... The letters are too small I have to squint my eyes like a turtle. Come on, do us a favor and delete this app already. No need to fix this stupid app. I hate it more than I hate my ex boyfriend.",negative
"They have degraded a lot in last one year. Constant mandatory popup to install app when you open web version is the most irritating thing. I used to surf via app previously but it drains the mobile battery so fast that I have uninstall and switch back to web version. Why can't you guys can keep running both version? Just because with app you can steal and sell more user data ! It is just a reading app , why does it want to consume so much battery and processor capacity! Work on efficiency guys",negative
"I just want to use the quora website, but as soon as I try to click another link it makes me open the app. I don't want another app on my phone. I have been asked to get the app nearly 30 times, and I'm so sick of it I just downloaded it. But the constant demand for me to get this app was very irritating, so despite the quality of the app, I'm giving it one star. Maybe I'd actually use this app if you would stop trying to shove it down my throat.",negative
"Stipid app... Why force me to install it to veiw the content now I've installed it camt load on my phone, i have tried both wifi and mobile data still app wont load page... Please fix this issue or delete this app from here and stop forcing people to download the app when its not working.",negative
"You ""could"" use this platform through Google, like many others. Making me download your d*m app to use your services is inconvenient and annoying. I deleted it originally because I never used the app portion, always used Google.",negative

"You forces me to download your app.i download your stupid app and after just uninstall bcz always it crashes,even not smooth as web version of quora.",negative
Why you force to install the app. The app does not work good in my mobile. Whenever i open the app phone hangs. Please let me use Quora in the browser. Please....,negative
"This app is not upto mark....though google can relate qstns ,quora app itself cannot...n also the way of handling questions,ans is very bad in the app!",negative
Don't take directly to clicked answers via browser rather redirect to home page. That's very frustrating if you only want to read a particular answer.,negative
"Ok, I installed this app only to give 1 star and to tell you that - ""STOP FORCING US TO DOWNLOAD YOUR APP!!!"" It's getting annoying to the point that if anyone come up with an alternative website with similar features, I will never use quora again. Only for these annoying pop ups to force people in installing the app. I don't even use Facebook app in my phone due to low storage in my device. What do you want, should I now buy a new phone to see a damn website!!! I'm uninstalling it now btw.",negative
"Rather It is amazing platform to share anything and it can improve many of your skills ‚ù§ but server speed is somehow lower than that of expected so due to just server issue i have given 3 star,don't mind hh..üòÜ",positive
"Stuck on ""Select 10 topics"", no matter how many I choose I can't dismiss the prompt, which renders the app completely useless. Well done. Edit: I was able to access the app by going to the website and selecting those 10 topics there. 1 extra star because the app itself is decent, but literally making it impossible for people to complete the sign up process through it is just bad design and forcing people to chose those 10 topics is bad in general.",negative
"I love Quora. However the app takes a lot of resources on my phone after a short while, until it crashes. That's alright, nothing is perfect, though I'd love to be able to continue reading the last answer before a crash, and not see a refresh of my feed. Finally, as of today and after reinstalling the app, the answers don't have a style sheet applied to the layout. I don't find that enjoying and will browse the website using Chrome. Hopefully the tech team will fix that.",negative
"Random language selection screens are popping up and blocking the view. It is very irritating, please correct it.",negative
"Whenever I am going to type an answer on any question from the App , suddenly it is getting crashed and i have to write from the beginning also in many cases i am not able to find the question again . Also , one more thing if you kindly introduce a tab for Writers about Total Read - time just like YouTube's Watch hours , then it will be fruitful for Quora Users .",negative
"The site was better when it was straight up just questions, answers and comments. Now, phttt! There's stories, there's so many sites for that. And all the advertisements in the world are now clogging up this site so bad it makes it hard as swimming up stream to find any answers to your questions. Too bad.",negative
Dark mode earnestly requested. Getting slower day by day although I am having a very strong internet connection,neutral

"Needs SD-card support FFS! As long as it doesn't have that, stop bugging me to download the app when I visit the site in my browser. It's annoying AF.",negative
After log in app asking to choose 10 topics that i want to see and after choosing option its not going ahed its lagging a alot and even its not opening please fix this problem as soon as possible.,negative
Can't get past the option where it has you choose 10 topics after first signing up. Even when you choose 10 or all of them. So stupid.,negative
"It's a great plat form BUT SUPER SLOW APP. Plus it's costy very costy. it doesn't support cache system so every time you touch any button you end up running the same process again and again. You have to load every thing again. it's slow, costy and of course notification master. 1000 notifs every morning is not fair. plus your email will get busy with dump notifs. you should really use their website instead. sometimes it stucks when you write a comment Even if your device is Sumsung Galaxy S70000",negative
Not able to use during night due to white background. Add dark mode.,negative
"Currently using Samsung S10. I installed the app then I was instructed to 'select a minimum of 10 categories of interest for my feed', when selecting 10 plus there is no button to accept the selection and going back just brings you to first section rendering the app useless for the time being. Disappointing.",negative
"Great concept but, when I tap on my notifications from Quora, they lead me to a blank screen in the app The answer I wanted to read is gone and I feel bad afterwards. Please fix it.",negative
"Worst experience, I always forced to feel embarrassed while using this app. You have to work a lot in making the user experience better..",negative
"Just plain horrible. I spent about 10 minutes typing a reply, and a popup asking me to confirm my email address appeared. I confirmed it, went back to the app, and my comment was gone! Don't install, it's a complete waste of time",negative
"Installed because web browser won't let you read the complete article and sends a pop up for mobile app. After downloading, asks to select 10 different topics. After selecting 10-12 topics, no progress on the screen. Can't see the next page at all. Everything stays the same. Very bad experience. Uninstalled.",negative
"Great for, learning, teaching, entertainment and trivia. Some of the answers are book facts and some are first hand experience, some are both. Plus, you get to answer yourself, but don't be surprised to get corrected. Great App!",positive
Each content takes a lot of time to load even though the internet speed is good,neutral
"Quora is one of the best app in my phone, unfortunately, lately there's a glitch everytime I tried to read some answers. The glitch is like code everywhere and I can't read the answers at all. Please fix it on next update. Thank you.",negative
What's the problem with this app.... First I installed and then opened but it didn't then I uninstalled and then again install (thought that there might be some problem) and I opened but this time it was loading again and I finally uninstalled.... And now sharing my experience.,negative
"I only downloaded this because the site wouldn't allow me to read on my browser. Which is restrictive and very irritating. Please undo this, as not everyone has space for a million new apps for each site they want to browse.",negative
Very bad experience - no night mode which much needed feature for this app. I really love the platform. Please do something about this.,negative
"I had the app and didn't like it so I went back to the web version. Only thing is that, if you scroll too far down one question's answers, it locks you out of the article and forces you to download the app. I love Quora but man, it's taking a dark turn towards another soulless business.",negative
"Stupid app. Kept asking for selecting 10 topics at least, I selected all of them, but it just wouldn't let me proceed and start using the app by posting questions or answers. What a waste of time",negative
Forcing to download the app to read some articles is really not a good marketing strategy.,negative
I'm giving 1 star because you forced me to download this app to see an answer. Why can't we see on browser. What's the problem? I will change my review to 5 star if you change this one thing. It's very annoying!,negative
I love quora ...but without app using is annoying..... I was reading randomly something in quora website.... Suddenly that page was turned ... Showing download quora...i downloaded it but that answer i was reading was gone... That's why u deserve one star,negative
"What an app ! Kudos to the creator ! I generally found boring in reading stories but man ! This app directly comes to the point every answer it highlights, is always looks epic. Love to spend time on this app...",positive
"Terrible app experience, freezes a lot. web is may better to use. But guess what, if you use in phone's browser, you can't because they will keep on forcing you to download app. Try to understand guys if a person is browsing Quora in phone's browser then why poking so much. This is frustrating.",negative
Hate the fact you can't use the browser version without it kicking you off to download the app. Waste of space.,negative
The app freezers a lot... Text area has multiple issues. Its very difficult to write and edit content in text area,negative
I made an account but as soon as I get on I have to check off 10 topics. So I do. After there was no way for me to actually do anything on the app. Could have been better,negative
Great content but poor app No offline capabilities. I have time to read a lot only when I have no network but this app wont even start when offline. :(,negative

"Asking me to choose 10 topic. Then after choosing, nothing happen. Only stuck on that page.",negative
This app has guided me thru such difficult situations.. thru questions and answers . Vast wealth of information ...in any and all subjects ...Recommend HIGHLY.!!,positive
"I can't even get into the app, theres some sort of bug that won't let me close that stupid check off what you're interested in panel",negative
app is useless as it takes longer to load the content and keep us in waiting time. i have good network coverage at home. all other apps are working great. but it takes a lot of time to load the content.,negative
It's a good app not just for only asking and getting answers..we can also improve our writing skills through it ..and also know about people opinions on different different matters.,positive
"Quora developers instead of understanding our problems and solving it in the app, they create new problems for users. Forcing users to download app, without even a close button in dialog box is very frustrating. I will never use Quora again.",negative

I just downloaded the app and then the app makes me select the topics and i dont know how to submit it so that i could proceed. Damned! Wasted my time! Uninstalled. Bye!",negative
"I do not care about the app. I prefer browsing online, the app is annoying and so are the constant notifications from it. But I can't just read quora from my email any more because of the pop up that leads me here that will not allow me to close it. Because of all of that, 1 star and I am uninstalling the app.",negative
"App asks me to follow more topics even if I've selected all of them already. And when that pops up, there's no way to close it but to restart the app and hope it doesn't pop up again.",negative
"quora is a great service, but their UX is atrocious. They have an otherwise top notch web app, which is literally unusable (and I mean literally) because of a pop up redirecting users to the app, with no option to dismiss. This hardball ultimatum of forcing users to install an app when a web app would be better, is the reason I am downloading the app, providing my feedback and immediately uninstalling it. Just let us use your website!",negative
"Id give it zero stars if i could. it associates itself with an email and locks it forever. you cant remove the address or change it. clear the cache and data, delete and reinstall the app. No luck. Im not into apps that try to control my basic options or browsing rights.Maybe if they want to pay for my device, id be ok with them giving themselves administrator priveleges over my setup. im deleting this trash. Done with the browser version that tries shoving this bs app up my @ss as well.",negative
I am an intermittent user and hate that I have to keep an app that should not be necessary. Browsing beyond a certain point without the app is needlessly blocked. 2 stars as I appreciate Quora in general.,negative
"It has amazing content and great quality. But here's the problem: developers, u shouldn't force the users to have an app cus we don't need it. It should be OUR choice whether we want the app. Alternatively, you could just ask us to make a Quora account to read the answers, y is the APP necessary? (ik it's for monetary purposes but don't u have morals too?)",neutral
I can't able to use quora . When I'm opening the app its showing to choose our intrested topics after tat there is no further goings. Plz fix it ..while using iphone there was no issues .now using android ..plz fix tis bug,negative
The app is the best but i am so disappointed as i want to read from it but it keeps bringing up this form to fill i have filled it....but it is still there,negative
"First of all i downloaded this app because i had to give you my review about you. Generally i use website of yours but most of the time when i am in between of reading something your pop up appers in the screen to download the app and i can't do nothing about,which is very irritating and i could not finish my reading.I mean how can you force someone to download the app.",negative
"I really enjoyed the website, until one day it threw up a pop-up asking if I had the app. Regardless of how you answer this question, it redirects you here and it cannot be closed without closing the window, popping up every few minutes. This would almost be excusable if not for how the app is a steaming garbage fire which makes reading questions a nightmare. I don't see why any developer would do this, if your app is so bad people won't use it then don't deliberately brick your website.",negative
"I used to love this app for the utility it provided but now, I don't know what's wrong with this app, the app freezes, takes a lot of time to load pages, answering a question is a headache now, the screen literally tends to feel like we're still in 20th Century. It's really sluggish. Please atleast make the UI animations perfect. A must note down. I'm highly disappointed with this kind of behaviour of the app.",negative

"3/13 --> 5/21--> 5/25 This is the third and final time I've had to complain about this issue. Aggressive and hostile marketing on your mobile site does not make me want to download your app. The popup ads on mobile didn't stop, and now I'm done using quora entirely. Whoever decided to include that popup on the mobile site should be ashamed of themselves.",negative

"Being forced to install while browsing on chrome. Frustrating really.. Deleting my past 2 year written well liked answers now due to new stupid moderation rules. I was a top writer in many video technology related topics , now I don't use it much. Very poor experience from a very old Quora user. I had tried Quora ads as well and they were also very complex to manage for multiple questions.",negative
Wonderful. I really love Quora. I can write about anything I want. I can share experiences and stories. It's my favourite media at the moment. I'd give it five stars but have recently had two answers incorrectly marked as spam (fixed afterwards). Will upvote once it doesn't happen again for a certain period of time.,positive
"So very informative of others' experiences and/or opinion. Exstensive array of topics,anything you can think of truly.",positive
"I haaaate this app. I thought it was just because I was previously using this app on an older phone, but I use it on this one and hardly anything has changed. It is difficult to navigate, and everything loads unreasonably slow, no matter what WiFi network I use. I don't even know why I got an account for this thing, anyone with sense will find anything faster with a Google search than with this app. And if you're asking questions about people's personal experiences, Reddit is better at that too.",negative
"I hate this app. I enjoy the daily emails and would prefer to read the questions/answers on the website, but every so often I'm forced to download the app or I'm unable to read anything. If I spend more than 20 minutes doing anything on the app, my phone starts lagging and I'm forced to restart it. Also, I tend to get a lot of oddball questions because I answered one thing once that was vaguely the same idea, and can't refine topics I'm willing/able to answer.",negative
My experience was pretty good. But this app needs some update. This app has lots of glitches. Please Quora team try to fix those glitches.,negative
"I love quora, so giving this feedback is tearing me apart. But you need to step up your app experience. The text field's horrible! I didn't get to answer the last 5 questions because it glitches when I'm writing/editing. It keeps freezing. Then the app crashes and my answer was ofc gone! It's such a pain to edit answers from the app. I decided to finally give a bad review because my phone froze from answering a question! What?? Aaargh! Damn you who don't listen you ruin my fave platform!",negative

This is a very bad app.In the above description it showed that it helps us to find answers but in real it is like facebook or Instagram where you can post your pics and get comments or likes.In addition we can only choose ten topics .....After all this is not good,negative
What's wrong with this app. I installed it and it is asking 10 topics to select. I selected the topics but it is not closing and not allowing me to ask doubts. Please fix this bug,negative

Stuck on selecting 10 topics. No back button or next button and also not automatically going to the next page even tho i already choose 10 topics.,negative

Poor quality app. Web page is far better. Vision is getting affected with its view.,negative

Its high time you bring the dark mode to quora. The only missing feature that a lot of users want.,neutral
"I also can not get pass the ""select top 10"" menu. Have tried a uninstall and reinstall. Kind of poo poo ey",negative
The app isn't very well optimized as others have pointed out. Suffers from freezing when typing out long responses and the layout and UI of it isn't as good as it can be. Quora itself isn't too bad but it does suffer from a 'better than you' attitude when it comes to some things however it's no fault of quora but rather the people who use it.,negative
The app content has already turned to trash since the past couple of years and now you are going for app only mode.,negative
Its too slow!!!!! Why would i use the app when my browser loads quora way better than this app. Improve it and make it load faster than the google chrome does. I am uninstalling this app right away. Sorry but its not the best i can have.,negative
This app is very slow. First I thought that it was my internet connection but later I find that it's the app. It is very very slow. Takes 1 to 2 minutes for opening a single page. I would use website rather than this stupid app.üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,negative
"MF. Keeps and hanging and all. The app is frustrating, y'all need overhaul.",negative
I installed this crAPP just so I can give it 1 star for the following reason: While on their website you can't browse the other related questions without them harassing you to install their app which is really stupid. There is no way for you to continue left or right. You're blocked right there and you have to install it. You have to absolutely install it. By now I blocked Quora all together from ever appearing on my search results because of that. Good riddance üöÆ,negative

"The older versions of app were better.This has a lot of problems, while logging in, while browsing.",negative
"Incredibly user-unfriendly and unfair practice to display invasive ad pop-ups on webpages that are perfectly accessible by browser, to force users to install your app. Yes, most sites that exist in both app and browser do this, but they are SUGGESTIONS and have an X button for those of us who would like to choose not to install and to continue in-browser.

Hi  My name is Lovepreet and I am a normal user of quora. I was recently very happy with the release of the dark mode on quora however as I started to use the dark mode it turned out to be utterly disappointing because the dark mode itself is way too dark .

"From the past few days, There's a glitch in quora.. I can't read answers properly as before. It's interface has some problem maybe. I request to the team of quora, please correct it as soon as possible. When I click any answers on my feed, it doesn't show answer properly.",negative
Concept I'd great but app is shittiest one. I end up clicking on ads accidentally. Ad placement is such that you'll be clicking on it accidentally and it'll redirect. It's really irritating. I hate this app.,negative
Why do you have to force mobile users to use your app? When the app notification pops up on your website there's no way to close it. Hate being 'forced'. Rubbish.,negative
Worse app. In browser it shows that first I have to download its app. But app isn't working properly. Very slow app,negative
This is app is very nice but now it becomes very slow and take few minutes to load. Which is really annoying thing about this app.,negative
Poor. Videos don't play and answers taking a freaking long time to load or they don't load up at all. Mobile site is better than this.,negative
"The worst app I've ever downloaded.. Even the apps with a lottt of graphics load faster than this. Didn't even wish to download the app, I was content with the website but No, you guys make us download it forcefully on mobile and don't let us browse peacefully on website. Waited for eternity for it to show even the home page but it won't open at all.",negative
Quora doesn't work smoothly ..it takes lot of time to open new page ... after having fast internet ...and also major problem with Quora that consume more battery than YouTube,negative

Because it doesn't work in browser properly...first it say sign up after sign up..it say download application,negative
"Very Good experience so far; Dark / Night mode and Font size customisation, especially for the 'comments', are highly warranted. Cheers!",positive
"I love the app, but the new update keep loading a funny looking page to the answers which alllows sideways scrolling. The upvote button does is not operational in this format. I have to either reload my feed and see new questions or I have to go to click the 'last update/answered' link to see the format I am used to. It's not nice. Otherwise it would be 5 stars becase I love everything else!",negative
"Why cant I just view the website with my browser instead of forcing me to download the app after the pop ups make doing so impossible. The pop up blocks the entire screen and the only options are to install the app or ""i already have the app"" both of which force you to close the browser window you have open. Not impressed.",negative
I can't do eney thing this stupid thing pops up on the screen and it won't go away! And it is something asking me about what other articles am my interested in and it will not go away even if you pick more than 10! So basically even though this app is meant for searching up stuff that you know nothing about I can't do that! So until this issue is fixed I'm going to rate it one star!,negative
"App is garbage. Great site originally, but shoving your terrible app down my throat has ended our relationship. Uninstalling.",negative

I love the purpose for creating this app but it is annoyingly slow in loading any page and not perfectly organised. Work on the speed and arrange icons well.,negative
Pls don't force us to install the app. My phone doesn't have space. No other similar websites does this. Plus the app is not good too. Gets stuck a lot. Pls make downloading the app an option and not a compulsory one. If not u r going to lose ur users soon.,negative

"The Quora website keeps harrasing you to download the app in between reading answers. And after clicking the link, the page refreshes and the answer is lost forever. Worst app advertisement. And when you finally download the app: in one it sucks. Extremely bad interface and highly user unfriendly.",negative
Last week I used to start this app thought that it might be useful for my jee preparations but within a week it put me under a lot of pressure.

"Quora's a great community. I just don't like that the site pulls you to the app everytime. Some of us have other things we'd like to check on Google. And on top of that, the app takes a while to load wasting the time we could've used to read our answers and move on.

Writing a review on the play store! Stop interfering. Let them choose. Give an ""apt out of app"" option. - A Paying Google One user.",positive

The worst app albeit the platform is real good. I never wanted to download the app at first place but it would never open on chrome always asking me to download it and so i did it.

Sometimes very innapropriate answers that are expected to hurt sentiments are given. As long as they are grammatically correct people can write all the rubbish they want . Also please add some sort of word limits because they go on writing articles. Some very misogynist articles have been published which really need to be checked out . Otherwise very informational and educative appüòä,negative

I visited there website and I can't explain how annoying their system is.They are just forcing you to download there app or sign up on the website.Don't waste your time downloading this app.,negative
"Fair app. Notifications can get a bit disturbing sometimes bt you can always turn it off. I feel they can have a disclaimer that not all the info provided here is true as I have seen people providing wrong info where they could use help of a professional. An example, someone had a question on why they were charged for a free trial on Netflix. And someone said it's because their 2nd month is going to be free. Wrong. Whoever was charged was just not eligible for it. I know as I work for Netflix :)",neutral

"Forced to Download App!! I actually have been LOVING Quora. Up to recently I've never had an issue... I notice now, about 30 seconds after clicking the forum it shows a pop up. This pop up asks you to try the app, or not right now. Even when I clicked ""already have the app"" it would still go to the google play store. So basically they make it to where you cannot x out of this and you're forced to download the app or you can't use the site. If not for this the app would have 4 or 5 stars from me!",negative

And right now it has become totally inaccessible, I mean I am not able to open answers in app, I tried to open it on chrome, but the websites indirectly forces you to switch to app again. I hope they would be able to make it run again, otherwise, I am afraid they will loose their loyal users.",negative
Its a really good app to get our queries answered I would have rated it 5 stars but it needs an update of in-built dark mode the bright white background consumes lots of power and sometimes its really irritating for eyes. Please bring such updates.,positive
I hate this aap because this people are forcing you to download there just to see some info on there web page every time you search something and the pop up dont let you go through.

"Im very happy with the content this app provides , but very dissapointed with the working . Sometimes doesnt load at all even if the network is good . Fix the problem damn",negative
"Stop trying to force a download of the app when viewing from the browser please. Those of us with limited space can't have an individual app for every site we occasionally visit, and just causes me to bounce off by offering no alternative to the app.",negative
Asking for update ? But what is new ? Please mention before asking updates. Your platform definitly provides useful information. Worth praise.,positive
"Anything that confuses me, i get answers from this app. What makes it more reliable is that many professionals and also those who study/experience the exact things are the ones who answer things you want to know.

"A few weeks hence Quora enabled started to support dark mode and there was an option to switch themes.

"As the length of the answer increases, the app starts to get less responsive and editing incorrect words is nearly impossible (with or without image attachments).

Every time i click on the question it shows a blank page nothing else. Unhappy with the app.,negative
Before forcing to Quora app please make it bug free. It's very hard to access it as it is super slow Earlier(2-3 months before) it was working all good but now it just irritates.,negative
Totally frustrating. Everytime it asks for logging in or to open the app or do something else.,negative
"Very poor optimisation .... My phone is running on Android 6... the app loads the home screen fine... But as i click ""read more"" a new tab opens which doesnt load and a grey screen would appear ... Why did you developers even think of such a low grade concept of openeing a new tab everytime i click ""read more""? Just display the rest in that screen only ... Very pathetic... After the update ... Its become worse... Do something about this as you call yourselves developers...",negative
The app is alright for the most part. Could be better in the ads department. Too many spamming the feeds. The reporting features are the worst part of quora. I don't think answers or comments should be so easily reported just because two or more get into a heated debate over a topic. Seems quite snowflakey in that regard. Could be a lot better. Could be a lot worse.,negative
I always love this app... But nowadays it's malfunctioning... Whenever I click on an answer it doesn't show at all even after waiting for 5 mins.... Please fix this problem.... But I will still give it a good rating.,negative
"I Have No clue As to Why The Dark Mode isn't Working, Tried to reach out on Twitter but to no avail, didn't get any Response, It's Really Disappointing.",negative
Managing topics is hard and gives a poor feed experience. Application is unresponsive when loading long answers.,negative
So disappointed with this updateüò™. When I click on a link or answer it take more than a minute to load even with 5G network. It must be fixed or we would have to uninstall.,negative
"Best app motivational ,entertaining at the same time you can take advice from others and give your answers I really enjoy writing blogs and help connect people from same passion great app worth download from the very first time and helped a lot on several topics .",positive
I use Quora whenever I stuck with any situation or tricky problems.This helps me a lot to understand things which examples given by knowledgeable people.Thanks.,positive
it forces me to install app while i was reading the article from my mobile. Edited: Nowadays this app insumes so much ram and hangs a lot. Poor app.,negative
A good app not a best one though because i opened it in my redmi note 8 pro and it was loading and showed something went wrong but when i searched something on google and through got on my quora app it worked so please see what it is,negative
"I find some questions very childish, and a bit silly, but some are quite interesting, I can only answer a question if I have some knowledge of that question,",positive
The app is very good. But the reason of rating only 4 star is the absence of dark mode in it. I request the team to please work on it and provide next update with same.,positive
"It's brilliantly smart forum but it's really annoying, forced to login, after login forced to download the app. I DO HAVE THE APP ON MY TABLET, BUT I JUST WANNA QUICK READ ON MY PHONE damnit.",negative
What the heck is wrong with this update??.. I am unable to open any answer üòë.. It shows white scene only everytime i open an answer.,negative
"This app lags in every aspect. Even with high speed internet connectivity the answers, photos, comments don't load.",negative
Change the UI now please! It's been a long time and I'm bored with this dated look.,negative
I absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE this app i always love scrolling through i see alot of good questions and answers and i read some really funny questions and answers to u can pretty much fine ANY QUESTON ON HERE and most of the time answers to them i would highly recommend this app to everyone and for sure üñêüèª‚≠ê ü§öüèªüå† üå†üå†üå†üå†üå† ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,positive

It's a knowledge hub where you get to interact with the contents of amazingly knowledgeable people.,positive
"Hi quora team... Why I am unable to see answers for questions in browser even though I logged in... It is saying open in app to see more... My mobile have full of apps.. Why I need to install so many apps. How my mobile supports infinite apps with less memory and ram.. Really if your motto is transforming knowledge, make it available in browser.. It is very annoying for me while searching for answers... First answer it will show with out logging. Second answer show after logged in.. Third answe",negative
Dreadful app. Used to work relatively fine in the old version. Now it crashes everytime i write a reply. I can't go through the notificatiom and answer section at all. It's laggy and slow to use. I hope all this gets fixed in the next update.,negative
"Dearest Quora, I was one of your fan. Literally, I liked this platform very much. Usually, I used this from the net but for the very first time I downloaded the app despite all those negative reviews. But I am greatly disappointed. This app is too slow to load and crashes everytime. Please consider this issue and help me to increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. Thankyou",negative
This update sucks. Links from Google search don't open in the app they take forever to load.,negative
Bad experience. You cannot zoom into the text or pictures. The content is mostly biased stuff written by amateurs,negative
I am not able to read anything .its takes a lot of time to load.plz fix these issues.not able to write anything.sad,negative
Had over a million views on my answers but they never appreciate you for using their platform. They will sell you ads but never appreciate you for growing their platform.,negative
"I enjoy it. Just signed up for too many places. Now I can't see all the posts as I am having trouble physically with my neck and wrist. If not for that, it would be great for anyone who can participate daily if they want be active.",positive
"Now a days,quora is not doing good..It takes alot of time to open content even my network is good..i cannot read answere properly ..and after reading some comment i think alot of people are facing problem..its a big problem..if it not solved there might be some people who gonna uninstall quora..",negative
"Changed my review from 5star to 1star. Been using this app since many years now. Used to be amazing app filled with knowledgeable and interesting content and was easily my fav app. Now it sucks big time, most answers seem to written by teenagers with little to no content. Uninstalled finally after holding onto it for years in hope. 0/10. Make quora great again.",negative
"The Quora app is amazing!!! There is an answer for every question i've ever asked! (Well, i haven't asked anything but there is at least one person who asks the same question i have and someone always has the answer for it, if you have trouble finding the question, try wording the question differently)",positive
App is not working properly it shows a black screen as soon as we click on feed it shows a black screen,negative
"Your website insisting I download this to browse on mobile is ridiculous. It just winds up taking up more storage space, which is o a premium for some of us. It is actively inconveniencing to those who would normally use your site. If you want the app to provide a better experience than the site itself, i.e. easy access to italics or mathcoding or the like, that's one thing, but forcing people to download your app to even use the site on mobile is just silly.",negative
"Earlier the app used to function without any problem but nowadays it has become too slow. It takes too much time for loading an answer. Overall the app is a good one. People on it provide good, valuable info.",negative
"I dislike quora policies. If you don't log in you have to log in to read other answers otherwise only one you can see. In web. If you click home page after log in. It wil not show after scrolling one time, you have a pop to mandatory installing of quora app. Bloody mother...",negative
Quara is what i was dreaming about.i always think there need platform for writers from every corner.on quora we can express our writings experiences and knowlege to the world.it has helped me in lot way.i suggest everyone should use this app.,positive
I can't open the full post. It show me a blank screen with a cross on the bottom. Its very annoying...üò§üòù,negative
The UI is aweful and makes the app unusable for me. When I'm done reading a question there's no way for me to go back to my main feed at the same point that I left and there's no chronological ordering. Every feed refresh has the same effect of shuffling everything. I'd like the main feed to be just the people and topics I follow. There's also a ton of spam or low quality content.,negative
The app doesn't open answers to any questions. All it shows is just blank screen whenever I tap on any answer. Please fix the problem asap.,negative
It takes years to open a answer. Also some of the amswers never open when its needed! Pathetic application.,negative
App is super but it takes too long to respond though phone has good internet connection and this makes bad experience.Can u solve this disturbance,negative
The popups to install app are really irritating when you read Quora on chrome. Sort it out.,negative

"Forces you to login on the website to read more questions, then again forces you to use the app when your trying to just read something quick on the website",negative
Definitely a good platform for age groups. Everything is here you want to know.,positive
"The app is awsome, I just love it. Small issue and otherwise app is good. You have to right questions in limit and some times you can't expect to describe your question with in the word limit.",positive
There are too many reasons behind for such low rating but I will mentioned here only 2.First one this application take too much time to open and 2nd is this app display only in hindi language even after I was set english as primary language.,negative
"Hey Quora developers and designers team. I m also learning designing today I updated my Quora android mobile app, and I found new FTA(floating action button) at the right corner of home page but the problem is its colors. It's background(circle) should be dark red quora Color and plus icon in center should be white.",neutral
"Sometimes after I have written on a notebook an answer to a question and return to paste it on the Quora website the question has disappeared. Why must I exit Quora toward a notebook? In every case after having written some pharagraphs, the short memory of this app collapses. Now if I write ""here"" will appear anywhere except here. I can't rate from the Questioner's point of view as I don't ask questions. In general the app works fine",negative
"I have phone which works very slow, and less RAM & ROM, I like to read Quora ans & Q but evrytime within 2 to 3 minutes when i login through browser it asked for download app or I cant access Quora, Give me a new Iphone or make Quora usable without problem (as mentioned above) on any browser, Its bias by you which make away from reading Quora...üò¢üò¢",negative
"When I open it in my browser, a message pops up after a couple of minutes, sometimes after a few seconds, asking me to download the app. Like they don't even give you an option to opt out. Secondly, when I tap on the ""I already have the app"" option, my *entire browser closes and Google Play opens up. * Who gave it the permission acess my device ?",negative
It's a good app. But it would be much appreciated if the developers include a Dark Mode. And reduce ads disguised as questions.,positive
"I would have rated 5 stars, but ther's that one thing that backed me and that was A DARK THEME. Most of the time before bed i scroll down on quora and after a few minutes, it takes my eyes off. So i request you to provide a dark theme on your next update.",negative
"Why am I forced to get this thing if I want to read it on my phone?! It works perfectly fine In my browsers, I shouldn't have the full screen blocked out and can't do anything else all because you want people to your stupid app!",negative
"Since have downloaded this app, have never used it. After logging in I won't be able to see anything, something will then pop up and starts loading and it won't stop, same goes to the site. You Guys really need to tell me what's wrong üò°üò°üò°",negative
It's not opening the settings page. It's stuck on home page only. I hope it gets fixed.,negative
Usually I don't review any app but believe me this is the worst app idiots who are maintaining this app are worst people. They are not caring what the user going through it will stuck loading forever. Shame on ur work.,negative
"Very nice way of linking with highly educated and having very high knowledge in therotical as well as practical,and proving their views with high statistics, it is a great honour to communicate with those people,and almost getting immediate reply, getting our self upgrading our knowledge without not only spending money also so information in hand by simply sitting in home itself ,and connting the same people with so much of knowledge ,like cheap availability, quality products,in depth knowledge",positive
"Nice app but it will be more helpful if you add trending topics menu, so that we can choose topic which we want to read. Thanks.",positive
"The app just presents a blank screen upon clicking read more. Rating 1* because I didn't find any developer support / an effort from Quora team to solve the issue even after 2+ weeks. I had previously rated it 5* , then 4* and reached gradually to 1* now. Disgusting ! And yes, I did updated the app multiple times and using the latest one now.",negative
"Useless app, very ridiculously slow to load. Even though the content is word only but still, it takes much more time to load than other app. Even opening an app full of picture us faster than this. Very disappointed",negative
Please fix the app. It's too slow and it crashes frequently. I'd prefer to use a web browser but you guys have taken away that option.,negative
"It crashes , the pages don't get load, literally unusable . for people who r facing same problem , my suggestion is open quora in firefox lite ,work as charm",negative
It's not working properly whenever i view any story it just shows a blank screen,negative
This app is just becoming so annoying ..you select a answer but that answer is not going to open up. You are only going to get a blank screen .and it takes so much time to load the data and crashes all the time.

"Love the website, the app is rubbish.. Constant blank screens and failure to load",negative
"I was enjpying the web version,until quora prompted me to download the app,the pressure was way 2 much and i finally gave in,i had limited storage so i had to uninstall a few useful ones to make space.its a great app and all,better than the web version,easier interface,but d way it lags and freezes is just too annoying,i wouldnt even recommend the app to my enemy because its darn annoying,its funny how they basicallu forced the app on me and i expected sth better Quora should fix this issue soon",negative
"After sometime using web version it leaves you no choice other than downloading the app, if you wish to continue using Quora. This alone isn't fair. User must have choice weather he wants to use the app or website. Keep it aside your app itself sucks. It loads slowly, even if I've good connection. It isn't intuitive at all. It doesn't have a good attractive user interface either. Notify me when you allow me to use web version or improve the app. I will give you 5 üåü",negative
"This app is not working properly, whenever I open this app it shows only error & get stopped itself again and again....I hope authorities will overcome this problem in upcoming update.....üòâ",negative

I really appreciate this app. It gives all the solution which and whenever I need. If you want some motivation in your life download this quickly,positive
Guys i cannot see any feed even though my network is connected..I cannot see anything except things loading.This is some kind of bug I think..Plz fix it I cannot use quora beacuse of it.,negative
its the better way 2 ask question and faster 2 get answer ..and it has dark theme so anywhere anytime i can learn but i works the same as old one it was not smooth it gets struck.if the interface is smooth it ll be awesome one .right now its the best one compared to others,positive
"I hv a very bad experience with quora. After installing this app, you send me an email of blocking my profile despite of using real name and when i try to complaint it there occue a system error.",negative
the app still froze a lot even after several updates and often not responding while being used so anything that i open and read just gone drowned kinda suck,negative
"Quora is a good platform,very usefull one ,but the only problem is that it is lagging very much even at high internet speed,i don't know why its happening.even YouTube videos are loading without buffering.Quora technical team please take this issue seriously so i can rate you 5 star.expecting a reply !",negative

"I hate that I have to download the app. i like just using the web version in my phone, but you force me to use the app to view content. I wish you would give a choice to just use the web version if we want to. It's even more frustrating that your app doesn't even work.",negative
"Supppper slow. On every click, screen goes blank and keeps on loading.",negative
"Quora used to be a really great platform a few years ago. I used to read a lot from quora, but now I'm going to delete my profile and this app. Why? I have found that instead of really touching and sensitive answers , the quora has become a place for spreading religious and political hate. More and more political propaganda and demeaning answers can be found here. I was hoping that this situation might change, I don't know if the platform management is sorry, but I'm sorry for still being here.",negative
"Terrible app. As some one who doesn't like sharing their info, this app doesn't care about your privacy. In order to ask a question you have to put ur full name and then it still doesn't work",negative
applocation is crashed after update. plz fix this. using LeTV2 mobile handset.. Solve this issue. It still crashed.when i open the app. Still no change. I cant see the question and answer. Still i face the same issue in june month. Juat launched lite version of it.,negative
Almost impossible to type text on this app. It is slow and stalls during input then places text out of order. Sometimes it inserts repeated characters away from the cursor. It also misloads articles frequently and gets stuck. I have seen this input problem before with other apps but rarely. This is difficult to use 90% of the time.,negative
Its a good app if you want to know public opinion about trending topics. But lately this app is troubling me a lot. I would be in middle of an interesting answer and app would close down own its own . It is irritating as now its happening more frequently.,negative
"The app is very annoying. It takes forever to load things and end up showing webpage not available. When I try to use my account on chrome it wants me back on the app and won't allow to use chrome. Coming back to the app, more than half of the time I see blank pages and too much loading. I tried reinstalling the app and cheers now I can't even get into my account.",negative

This app is garbage. All it shows me are rumors & gossips related to personalities on my homepage & nothing else. Literally NOTHING ELSE. Even though I've selected various topics but all it shows me are rumors & gossips.,negative
"A lot of times when I click on something all the way down in a timeline, pressing brings me all the way to the top. Please take note of this and fix it if you can",negative
"Easy to use, through quora getting lot of new things, very helpful for spread the information... Great application, i just love it",positive
Excellent App for people who regularly searches for general doubts. And the replies for those questions are satisfied enough...,positive
One suggestion. If we could save the useful answers for later it would be really helpful. I'm facing real issues with this app. Unable to comment on the answers. Getting collapsed. Pictures do not load.,negative
"Your app sucks!!!!!!! There's nothing good in the app. The platform is very good but the app is very poor. It just doesn't open up answers, sometimes notifications, sometimes my profile, sometimes the whole app doesn't open!!! It gets very annoying after some time!!!! This is the main reason people opt for other social media platforms and are leaving this beautiful platform. Pls pls do something about it üôèüèª",negative
Good app starting off and lately it's just been offensive with the content I have been receiving. Hence the 3 stars.,negative
"I found Quora on Google and quickly got addicted, if I wanted new fashion trends, answers for questions, and some drama I'd do to Quora! I recommend it since it's a easy to use app and doesn't require much to set up, I used my Google account since it has a different Email and Name if I ever got into trouble with my main email, but it is useful since I use my Email account for everything so my other accounts are safe. I'll highly recommend this app since it has answers for everyone!! I adore this",positive
"I liked this app very much! But now a days, it shows a blank page when i click the answer üò¨ fix this dump problem.",negative
This app is now becoming problematic... The interface is confusing to use and there is NO dark theme...Some improvement in required!,negative
Nothing is ideal as we all know...well the app is really good but thefact is that nothing is ideal so that's why i m giving it only 4 stars.....but this app is awesome....i must say...üòçüòç‚ù£Ô∏è,positive
I would give this application a 5 star if the big annoying red floating button can be removed in my timeline homepage..,negative
it's a great app and i would have given it 5 stars if only the answers would be shown. I am facing this problem since i have downloaded it whenever i ask a question i am not able to view the answers please fix it!! There's no use of this app if the answers of my questions can't be shown,positive
The content of this app is good but the content doesn't loads. It just shows white screen which never loads. It's getting annoying day by day.,negative
It crashes in every 10 minutes. In between my reeding and destroys my concentration.,negative
The previous version was good however when i updated it I am unable to open answers as it shows a blank page. please fix it ASAP,negative
NO THANKs... Would give 0 stars if I could for trying to force people to download to the app instead going on the website on a mobile browser. Have limited space...... Thanks.....,negative
"The app is good. I'm not using it fully, only scroll through the notifications and read what interests me. However, giving one star less as some of its contents are lacking key essential information. I understood that it's Q&A type platform, hence answers may lack some info.",positive
The overall app still seems to be in beta mode. There are bugs everywhere. Over the years Quora has become more of a joke (the content).,negative
Why quora group always try to force me to use the app version of it despite my google account being linked with it......it's really annoying.....,negative
There is an issue with this app that takes more time to load a page.I have to open it's website.I guess the functionality of website is better than this app.,negative
"It's an excellent app for an over curious being like me. But I have one issue, It takes too much time to load the content, which is very irritating!",negative
I haven't had any problems with the app at all. I answer questions and ask questions and I give honest and trustworthy answers. I must say though some of the questions people ask are just plain ridiculous! I think they try to think of the stupidest questions they can! I answer those questions with a smartass answer because the questions don't have answers. Example: why doesn't Amazon sell planets? I answered because they don't have a real estate license. How do you answer that? It's annoying!,negative
"I used to love spending hours and hours reading fascinating facts and stories on this website. Used to. It has become a hive of propaganda for the Chinese government. I thought I could fight the good fight, and reply to the hoards hiding under VPNs. Their tactics have since changed and now any challenge to the CCP narrative will find your messages flagged and deleted for ""harassment"". I've tried contacting Quora directly, but they seem happy to lick Xi Xingping's boots. I've had enough.",negative
"This app eats way too much battery,,, i guess maybe because in the app screen the pixels are outputting shades of whites which tend to consume more battery. I hope the dark theme for this app might fix battery drain to a certain extent. Waiting for the dark theme update.",negative
The worst app ever. It takes forever to load the page. Website of quora forces you to install app. They neither allow you to use browser nor their app let you read.,negative
full of useless people. hard to find good answers. used many times. but disappointing most of the time. people have a created a political war room on Quora üëé Every where Left Right ü§¶üëé,negative
"Very good experience , I really appreciate this app for such a wonderful questioning and answering platform.",positive
Worst app cant even launch properly. Takes too much time to upload all the content . You become so frustrated that you will break your phone of uninstall this useless app either,negative
The new update which shows spam notification in home really sucks. I literally unfollow each and every other topic that I used to follow earlier.,negative
This app has good content but this app is not working properly. So much irritation to use. So just uninstalled. Hope it'll get better soon so I can use it again.,negative
"I absolutely hate that i was forced to download the app when browsing quora via web browser. I couldn't view the answer i was looking for because of the pop up. The app should be optional. If I'm ever asked about quora by a friend I will not recommend. The site is great in and of itself, but screw them. I don't have much storage on my phone and I'd rather keep it for apps I actually need like for banking. You lost respect quora, and I'll make sure people know.",negative
"Good to try the app after being a regular Quora user on a browser for years. After a few weeks of usage made force back to browser. Way more than notifications than I wanted and the notification menu settings are cluttered and confusing. There was dark mode for easy night reading earlier, but after the last app update the dark mode switch is missing. And I would suggest not to force your users to use the unpolished app when they already enjoy the amazing Quora on a browser.",neutral
"This app is ok. That's about the best I can give it. Also, if you give a positive comment, there always has to be that one person that has to start the bitching. God help you if you misspell a word because that will get corrected too. There is also that one person who has to take every subject and turn it into a political bash. It could be a post about elephants and somehow, it gets related to politics or trump. And if you love bashing the USA, this is the app for you.",neutral
About an year old posting by me yet to be provided the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Even two reminders went waste. Receipts by Quora of all 3 postings were acknowledged promptly.,negative
"Why are you forcing me (and end customer like me) to download the app forcefully, if I have subscribed for mail notification, have guts to show the feed in browser only, no need to forcefully download the app. I will never ever download the app if u force me lyk this and swear for multiple complains in multiple platforms. Don't do this....",negative
"Much as i enjoy Quora on tablet and laptop, the mobile app leaves much to be desired. The only reason i hesitate to say nothing works is because i have not been able to get any of its initial features to perform, and therefore cannot get past them to explore others! It loads very slowly. then after clicking a question the answer window loads even more slowly. Worst of all after a full answer is selected, the screen displays an answer to a different question. Frustrating. Please fix this.",negative
"Posts are not loading at all. I click on the cards, then white screen appears with 'x' mark at bottom. It doesn't load any content even after waiting for 20 minutes. It's irritating! Please do the needful.",negative
"Forced to install it. On mobile, it is not possible to view the web version always, as ot forces you to use this app, with no extra functionality.",negative
1 Star. Nothing wrong with the app. Forced me to download this app when I opened a link to another answer on website. No option around it. Terrible concept when you want to find out something and need to wait for the app to download so you can read the single thing you searched for.,negative
"Earlier it used to work fine, but now i am never able read the answers Whenever i press ""read more"" for any answere in my feed the page wont load and would juat show white screen.",negative
Fix the bugs guys please... Quora has always been my favourite app!! But these days...maybe since two three months it keep saying loading though the internet is super fast... Do fix it please as soon as possible.,negative

Too much lag. App unresponsive most of the time. Please check.,negative
When i add arabic language as second language all the app turn to arabic and the english language disappeared even in the language setting it says that english in your primary language,negative

"These days it's not showing the stories, simply it displays we have no story for you. I keep it refreshing numerous times. This is really disappointing.",negative
I haaaaaate this app. I have never seen such an useless app. I have downloaded this and finished my network uselessly.,negative
enjoy this app. always assorted variety of reading subjects . something for everyone.,positive
"Something is wrong in the new update.........when i try to open a post,the screen becomes blank",negative
"I love this app but I really hate the constant political questions and answers. It has become quite toxic and trying to use and nothing less than the toxic landfill that twitter is. I agree it might be my fault that I showed interest in politics initially but now when I want to distance myself from it, there's seriously no easy way to manipulate the algorithm. So out of frustration I had to delete the app.",negative

The app is too slow and hangs allot i prefer using the site but they keep on redirecting me to the app it so annoying,negative
It's great!!! Helps me pass time n I use it as if it were any other social media like Instagram !!,positive
Very slow app.. I like the contents and features! But it's very slow and sucks.. I cant comment or answer in any questions as I type letters comes on screen very slowly(I have other apps in my phone which works perfectly in my phone Samsung galaxy j5prime) . Plz fix this problem of app.,negative
"Don't you make us install the app forcefully, when I want to just access from browser I cannot continue without installing the app. That's certainly not fair. People will install app in case they need. Please remove the pop ups from refraining us from usual go.",negative
"This is educational, informative, inspiring, enjoyable in fact it is the best in all ways. Awesome!",positive
"It could be better if it has a night reading mode, we mostly use quora at night, that's why four stars... Also Quora should have a feature of saving answer for offline reading because in some places internet sucks.... I hope my review will reach quora soon and they will accept my recommendations in the next update of quora.",neutral
"App not functioning properly, slow, laggy. Overall much worse than the last time I installed it. Edit 06/2020: if I could give zero star, I would. Forcing people to download app when the quality of said app lower than garbage? Nah. Quora has been doing this for a while, I guess it is really asking to be abandoned?",negative
the app is wonderful for people who seek knowledge. however at times it becomes slow to operate for unknown reasons.,positive
This app is a disgrace. Whenever I open it takes 5 minutes at least to load anything. Even then the experience is not smooth. Everything is sticky. Page load takes enormous amounts of time. Feed is a waste.,negative
"This app is buggy and slow if you use it for more than 2 minutes. The website version is way better but it just forces you to use the app on mobile. Also, posting a question should make you automatically follow it, even if you posted it anonymously, in my opinion.",negative
It's a good app but you need to improve on it and make sure it auto rotate when I auto rotate my phone,positive
"Such a slow working app though content of this app is too good but it doesn't work smoothly ,please quora team improve quality of this app",negative
Very good but it just changed from dark mode to light mode and I've been finding it hard to use since then..no option to return back to dark mode,negative

I can't believe that there was an excellent source out there and how to deal with a horrible narcissist. Thank you for all your help!,positive
Not so much an issue with the app itself but it royally pisses me off when im viewing things online and then i get forced into the app in order to view something just because Im on mobile. The app should be optional. Not everyone has the memory space on their phone to have all the apps in the world on it. Quit shoving your app down people throats when they try to view the actual website on mobile. Kay? Thanks.,negative
Its better then playing multiplayer game or other games and wasting time in social media.. Excellent for lernig something new,positive
This 2020 and still no dark mode. Issues with opening answers at times. This is just being lazy...,negative
After overcoming so much I had really wanted to help others. Enable to do this I had to put my life & safety on the line with my real name on Quora. As a survivor of domestic abuse when I saw my real name was posted I quickly changed it. An app to post & learn about real-life challenges but not if you're a survivor! I obviously chose the safety of myself and small child and immediately deleted my account. If you too are a survivor Quora will refuse to let you help others,neutral
I can't ever remember using this one however from the quick descripstion ubove its the torsue of knowlege and comprehtion. Now if i can get refershment couses on my lange classes on your basic high school knoledge id be fine .lol,neutral
"This app used to be very good a few years ago. But now the UI has worsened a lot. Everytime I open the app it asks me to login and when I click on answer, it opens another. Search option is also useless because you can't get the results for what you search, even though it is on quora. There is a lot of things in UI that the developers should look into.",negative

There should be text size adjustment feature. Because small fonts makes user less interested in stuff.,negative
Hello technical team please fix the bug. it takes many times to open,negative
"A great app for everyone out there. Only one suggestion - adding a dark mode would make it an even better app and make content easily readable at night. I've been waiting for dark mode since a long time. Rest everything is awesome. Update: i've seen people getting dark mode. With every new update, i hope to get it on my app. But alas, still not available.",positive
"Too slow, the questions take too long to load and after clicking there is also long delay. Using browser was my alternate option but you also made it mandatory to push users to use the app.",negative
"I needed to install this app just to search for a specific question on your site. Very dissapointing that someone with an account on your site isn't even able to access the information. Btw, I will delete the app after I read the specific question.",negative
Loads very slow when ever I selects a question and takes much more time to open.. Very frustrating n irritating.. Pls fix it,negative
"If I could give zero stars, I would! Won't let you view the website for long if at all without literally forcing you to get the app, makes an account with your facebook information without asking, and who knows what else it's up to that's shady and gross! 0/10 DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!",negative
Pathetic app! Compounded by the fact that their annoying notification keeps insisting you install it.Not worth it though.,negative

It use to be a good app but suddenly it started dropping. The problem is It won't load and show what you search and click on. It will be nice if you can fix it.,negative
Mentally distrubing this process of forcing to download the app. Very very dissatisfied blog which gives waste information which cannot provide its own. Google is enough for search quora is no necessary,negative
"Very disappointed by the fact you force mobile users to download your app. I rarely use this app, and when I do its only breif. I find the website so much more convenient, but you force us to download, we can not close the 'Use quora on mobile', no matter how hard we try. The fact how I have to reinstall it and uninstall(for space, I have very little, and the space I do have/use is for my art) several times frustrates me. Let us use your website on mobile, stop pissing us off.",negative
"The quora website forces you to use the app, I don't mind pop-ups suggesting to download an app. However an window you can't dismiss which prevents you from finishing reading an answer is just horrid",negative
"I like being on Quora. However, I have a problem with the typing answers section. I am used-to typing in landscape mode, but Quora doesn't allow me this option. And this is what makes me avoid writing long answers. I will rate it 5 stars when this gets fixed.",negative
"It lags so much, sometimes when you open to read something it first shows the last story which you opened, then after 10 seconds it will open the story which you want to read. And also it is too slow.",negative
Good community but... The app connectivity is slow in a weird way... Loading photos and feed takes a lot of time,negative
"I was forced to install this app and in exchange what I got? This is just a dedicated mini browser for Quora! I could use my normal browser but nope, they don't want that.",negative
"Application was good... Lot to learn from this app...but now it's more like Facebook.. unverified content .misleading news..no fact ,adult content etc.",negative
Too slow to load. Keeps showing blank screen. It loads fast in browser but they keep insisting to use the app which never loads,negative
"Used to love it, but just got slower and slower to boot. 30 seconds to load a question you notified me of? Ridiculous. Get below the Doherty threshold, I'll come back.",negative
"I tried to access Quora using Google Chrome on my phone. After 2 pages, it gave me 2 options ""Get the app"" or "" I already have the app."" The pop-up flatly refused to move despite several attempts & refreshing the page. So, for forcing users to install your app, I am, instead of installing the app, giving you one star. I have also started checking my profile for answers I might need later & saving copies of them. I will delete my profile for good after that. You cannot force someone to install your app by refusing service. Shame on you, Quora!",negative
When we open site in mobile browser it force to download app. Why we will load our mobile when we can use it easily in browser.,neutral
Doesnt support multiscreen in 2020 and performance issues and bugs. This app sucks im uninstalling,negative

"I love Quora, but the text editor in the mobile app is pathetic! It just hangs for a few seconds every time I move the cursor while typing, and today it tried to crash my system UI. I was facing this issue a couple years ago and had stopped using the app (and also the platform in effect) because of it. I came back to the app (and platform) recently and am facing this issue again, this time on a different phone and Android version. Terrible! Fix it.",negative

"Quota forcing users to download it's app, if I'm logged in through the browser, I should be able to view the site as well without having to download your stupid app. You can get your revenues via ads. Why do you want to force it down our throats?",negative
App is horrible. I'm spending more time for loading the answer than reading. Been waiting for an update for these bugs but none of the updates actually rectifies.,negative
"The only problem I with it (and this is a big problem for me) is that whenever I write, the keyboard will be all laggy and glitchy, i checked and it wasn't my phone, all the other apps are fine but not this one, please fix this",negative

"It's still not working in my mobile (vivo) ,whereas working on other mobiles of my family members, couldn't understand what's the issue, have many times updated ,but still the same problem, neither have got any response from the developers",negative
"when i tap on ""read more"", it only shows the person who wrote the answer, and not the answer itself. i'm not tapping anywhere near their profile.",negative
I'm rating one star because the keyboard is lagging and answering questions is becoming increasingly frustrating. I am an avid writer but the lagging of the keyboard is making me want to quit.,negative
Keyboard lagging is very frustrating. I love the app but the keyboard is messing up my entire android system. Needs to be fixed asap.,negative
Love what they've done with the UI ! Simple yet sturdy and productive.,positive
What the hell is wrong with this app? Links won't open. Images won't be downloaded. App interface is so poorly designed that on clicking back you lose every way to the previous answer. The pages consume more data than it should. Not at all user friendly.,negative

Initially it was good but now the app shows too many sponcered posts also the interface is really bad after the recent update,negative

Additionally whenever I'm trying to use the website for reading there's an irksome notification which doesn't let me continue, asking me to switch to app.",negative
Application doesn't work smoothly it doesn't work on low network.try to make it light so many posts take lots of time to open.,negative
Quora is a fabulous platform but the app is a let down. Previous versions were all right now the read more link leads to white screen. Clearing cache reinstalling doesn't work. Please do adequate beta testing before you push out updates.,negative

Please FIX IT because it's really affecting my experience with the app and unless done this is not really the kind of service I and many others would recommend to people. Thank you in advance,positive
Quora is good but the mobile app is absolutely terrible. Keeps crashing and tapping one answer opens up a completely different one. Nightmare.,negative
The app is too slow and it takes a lot of time to search or load an answer. I have many requests pending by now and it takes me spare almost 20sec for every question to load and the keyboard to popup. I know this can be a problem with my handset but other apps work fine.,negative
"Not the App but the website. You shouldnt have to download the app just to do a quick search. But when i tried to read the results, it forced me to download the app because i could either download it, or hit the back button.",negative
I wish I could put 0 star here because your site has been a frustrating experience for me. There are many ways to engage your users and offer mobile app but forcing people to download the app just to read more is definitely not the right choice.,negative
this is very usefull and interesting app.i like this.there are some aesthetic and 4k wallpaper.wallpaper ar very nice and beautifull.i like it.,positive
"Why this app hangs so much. Crashes frequently. Most of the time I can only see ""Something isn't working"". Spend time writing a long ans and then boom the app crashes, all gone..

"Not user friendly. Unnecessary pop up stop follow spaces and stuff and new window for everything and when you press back it takes you to home screen whereas you just want to go a step back.

"App keeps freezing, especially when I am typing. The cursor also moves around while I am typing.. very annoying! I can't use this app freely. I don't have anything running g in the background that should make my phone this slow! Ads bog up my screen making it difficult to read answers quickly..

Today there was a link on Quora for an article about how Google tracks us to make us into the product. The article was incidentally dated the same as my birthday. Quora allowed me to read it, halfway thru. Before demanding I download this app to finish. Judging by the other reviews, this is a shoddy app. I downloaded only to review, and am uninstalling immediately.",negative
"I absolutely love Quora! The app is really user friendly, but the best part is the myriad content a user can explore and participate in! Each day I find myself wanting to learn something new, so I'm very pleased by the diverse and intriguing topics and enthusiasm amongst the Quora-ians!!",positive
"There was a time when Quora had good contents and a plenty of things were there to learn.. But it has changed completely. Now people can post ""anonymous"" and they are posting whatever they like. Misleading by promoting ones's own products / services / institutes and demeaning others' is pretty common now. You can't track them since they are ""anonymous"".

"Having Quora on my phone has given me access to more knowledge than my local library. My best description; it is like having Einstein as a friend on Facebook. This one single app is probably educating more people with current information (much from the top people in their fields) than all the universities on the planet on any given day. If your having problems understanding, or helping your child in difficult subjects Quora is the place to turn. Best app on my phone hands down.",positive

Well I don't know why Quora doesn't enable a dark mode feature. Even the dark mode in built our device doesn't work on Quora.

Sorry for giving 1 star but I had to because the mobile website wouldn't let me use the website until I downloaded the app. It wouldn't even let me close the pop up which asked me to download the app. Downloaded the app just for this review and I'll uninstall after the fact. It also sucks that we can't even use the website without an account. This is the kind of site I would have normally checked out but I hate not being given a choice (to login or not) so it's a no from me. Peace.,negative
Very educational on mental health issues. I have learned a lot reading the information located on Quora.,positive
I would have given the app 5 stars if it wasn't so slow in loading stuff. Hope they take a look into it....,negative
The app is not having Dark mode enabled nor it is present in settings to enable it. Please update the app by having dark mode setting present. The version of the app is 2.8.56.,neutral
"Please that works on 2G, because many people want to learn and earn by using this app...Im the number one who promote to this if you do please update system to browse fast. Thanks",positive
One of the worst apps on playstore..slow and super laggy..pathetic developers at Quora..also Quora doesn't allow to read more then one awnser on browser so I am stuck with this piece of shites app. I hope there is a competitor soon and Quora ups there game.,negative
Some articles are really good and knowledgeable but most of the time people try to push their politcal agenda through this app.,negative
First I had given 5 star now I am giving 1 star it's bcoz it's not working properly.. need to fix all the problems.. it's take so much time to open any answer.. and when I click on any answer it only show author name and follow option..,negative
"It's really annoying man.... 90 percent of the time when I opens the app its shows ""something went wrong"". Even my Internet connection is proper and all other apps are working properly but still its doesn't loads... Changed rating form 5 to 1. Your team really need to work on that.",negative
"Great concept, great website to learn but one of the worst user interface i have even seen in my life, both the app and the main website. You should change your UI & UX team. followed a lot of questions but if i want to access the answers of that question then there is no easy way, instead of showing me the answers of these questions, it shows me random recommended question's answers. There is too much new disorganized concepts like space and too little customization. Lot of change is needed.",negative
Could use some improvements. The user interface and the amount of data it takes.,neutral
Not fully the app's fault but some parts of the community is getting toxic. Some questions have upvoted answers from nonexpert when the expert ones are hidden below. Some people attack if you disagree with them (no matter how respectful you try to say). BRBT? Hmm i don't think so. Some technical issue for mobile app is that sometimes it's laggy and you keep going back to home after clicking a question. Pls just google your answer somewhere more valid.,negative
"i thought my network connectivity was bad but apparently everyone experiences the same. please fix this, its a good site.",negative
"Forcing to use a slow, lagging app is not good for your service. It was good using online Quora.",negative
One problem....I always upvoted answers so i could go back and read in activity....But activity always gets refreshed every week or so. Later i realised i coildve bookmarked them. Now i have no upvoted answers in activity as all is refreshed by quora.,negative
On the website after loading up it says download app or i already have the app. No matter what you click it takes you to the app store and you cant exit out of the popup. Fix this it is completly pointless,negative
I was forced to download this app when they won't let me view their website from my browser üò≠ I eventually downloaded it and Its just too slow; takes ages to load. Hope you guys can do something about it. I'm getting pissed.,negative
"Downloaded the app just to give 1 star. I have no problem with quora, but when the web site makes it impossible to read more then 30 seconds until it gives an unclosable popup add it get 1 star.",negative
I once used to adore this app. Now it's just a ground for psuedo intellectuals to feel good about themselves. It's hard to navigate. Takes time in loading up. Can't find what I want to see about.,negative
"The name policy is annoying, there should be an option to use initials or something for people who don't like their name being out there, it was working fine with a username for a while then it blocked me for improper name, i fix it and it doesn't help.",negative
The app isslow and sluggish but now it's crashing at an alarming rate.,negative

"So much more than I anticipated! I got advice from teachers, parents, therapists and others who have knowledge and experience. A variety of them shared stories their particular area of experience, ranging from hilarious to heartbreaking, and I read some contributions that turned out to be essential in this time of my life. Thanks for a wonderful app and those who care to share their insight. I'm so excited to find this and finding myself turning to it more all the time.‚ò∫Ô∏è",positive
"Great content. . Amazing answers... I gave one star because of the poor quality of the app.. I have forgotten my pw, after I took a break, and now I'm locked out of my account, stuck in an endless RECAPTCHA loop trying to prove I'm not a robot.",negative
"Great simple elegant app for members to connect, interact and network.",positive
"The aap is taking too much time to open, sometimes it stuck white screen. Please fix it",negative
Who is on other side who is constantly changing this app to worse. They removed 'Topics' and then 'spaces' .i can't find them easily. Do it like in 2018 idiots,negative
"Quora is really nice to read articles and posts because I get to read so many things here I've never read before. But as an app, it is really bad. After continuous usage of this app, it becomes really slow. And if I'm writing an answer and if it's long, after writing so much, the app suddenly crashes and the answer is just gone. And sometimes, even after saving as a draft, the draft is nowhere to be found. Please improve these issues, this app could do so much better.",negative
The app freezes and slows down after I read 10+ answers. Also heats up my phone.,negative
The upvote feature is not at all working. Its just appears and disappears. Also the app is very buggy. Fix these issues before you lose your reputation,negative
"Buggy, keeps recommending undesirable content, even if you keep rejecting/down voting the content.",negative
"I just hate the recommender system of the app. I don't know why it keeps showing me meme questions by the name ""best screenshots"" even after downvoting them. It's truly not productive. I also just hate the overall UI of the app as it's not user friendly.",negative
"Hate the app because i was FORCED to download it! i was using a browser and it forced to login with my facebook or google account that i didn't want to do, but then they even force you to download an app? Like seriously?!?!",negative
"Worst app ever seen..whenever i searched something ads pop up and completely disturb me i was using it on crome and it suddenly ask me to get app from playstore of quora and i click on not now then the i returned to search bar of google the whole page of qyora was gone this makes me very angry......and dont download this,worst app ever seenüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï",negative

Mobile push notifications don't have a single on off that I found. Have to go into tons of spots to turn of individually. Uninstalled.,negative
"I hate the fact that they made me download the app to be abke to access other articles from the website using my phone. Hate it, don't force me to do something that you want me to do. Really put me off to the platform.",negative
"The App is really useful. But the loding speed is too slow. Please provide a dark mode for this app, because most of the people are using this app for longer time.It will make comfortable to scroll through the feeds. Hope the developer could solve these suggestions.",neutral
"Crashes regularly, comments icon doesn't responds, loading takes so much of time.",negative
"This app fools you in believing that you will be able to get answers and also answer questions of others but this is a very biased app! They have a biased panel of judges who can outcast you simply they don't accept your views personally! There is no barrier between countries, regions etc. So anyone from any place can flag your question/answer and if that person is a woman, the panel will always take the women's side! Hence a biased place! Also they are racist with whites having the upper hand!",negative
"Take more time to load a content I will be irritate to user point of view, so fix this issue ASAP otherwise looking good",negative
Keeps on stopping and hanging the phone. Even after complaining no response have been received.,negative
"Changing my 5 stars to 3. The app is now very slow and just won't open what you want to open. You click on one answer, and either the answer above or below that opens or the answer u last opened in history opens up. Comment section also opens very slowly. Increasing ads everywhere is the least of my concerns amongst all.",negative
"App is really good.. but , pls provide dark theme to make us feel comfortable while reading at night.",positive
"it is the best website. Its all about learning , understanding and giving feedback regarding the military. Before i found this website , I had zero knowledge regarding the military. There is so much to learn. I am thinking about making a blog and adding quora digest . Not now, I need more time.... Every question that has been asked whether by me or someone else is thorough. This website is not advertised : If it was , It would have extremely high ratings.",positive
"Quora is basically a platform to share thoughts and knowledge of anything and everything. With app it should have become a convenient option to use, but it crashes every other minute.

"Useless app that is slow. I don't want to use this app. Quora, what are you getting out of trying to force people to use your slow app? Why can't you allow full answers to be read on your desktop site? So frustrated.",negative
This app doesn't directly open the topic that I've already searched on the Quora website. You have to search it again the same thing on the app,negative

Total disappointment (It always shows blank page)... We are fine with website. Better improv app version or stop forcing people to install Quora all the time.,negative
"A nice community, Always useful. A must-have application for every single phone. we all have hard times through our lives, this app is great for help.",positive
"Extreamly slow,can't see content for atleast 5 minutes after launching the app.",negative
First you make registration compulsory to see answers then I register my self. After this you make app installation compulsory but I don't know. I only use it on my browser. so please don't make it necessary.,negative
It's best app for sharing and gaining knowledge. But these days it's turning into social media.,neutral
Quora is an amazing application . Through out we can discuss regarding our profession and Valuable unknown things . It's just helps me a lot . You can bookmarks all the content of revleant summary. Also can hold upvote click . But their is no DARK THEME which I love the most while reading in mobile.,positive
"When i view in website , it constantly pesters me to open in app... just another method to eat my battery ..installed quora app only because visiting website made it mandatory to install this app inorder to navigate various answers ..this needs to change",negative
Worst App. The App is not fit to show any answers properly. Max it can show is blank pages. Kudos for all the work done. Users are frustrated due to this half baked receipe.,negative
"I need help with my account, they kinda blocked me saying that im not using my original name, even tho im using my real name, and now i am unable to upvote or leave comments there.

Pls help me!!",negative
"Laggy, unresponsive and when it does decide to work be warned some content shown and questions asked are gut churning. At least with Reddit they warn you well beforehand what you're reading. Most ads are spam scams. Age rating needs to be upped to PEGI 18. Ended up Deleting the app and my account.",negative
"Used to be a good informational app, now it has just became a political propaganda platform. If developers add the filter of unselecting-answers from a particular country. I may come back. Just selected the deletion option from the app, hope it gets removed because I want to put away all those negativity of political propaganda by Indians in literally every and any type of questions. Bye bye",negative
Answer by people are amazing .. But the quora interface as well as its response is very disgusting .The touch response is worst .plz fix these problems .Also introduce different background to make it more attractive and usable,negative
Why quora app suddenly get stuck after giving one such answer or post please fix this issues. It really start irritating me.,negative
This app does not working properly even in good network area. Questions answers take too much time too load. everytime i refreshed it and got the same timelines again and again! I really like to read from quora but sometimes its irritating!,negative
It's really a good app.I had been enjoying reading the articles.It is a useful app as well as a better app to kill time.But i want the operating of the app should also be easy.Except that I don't have any complains.thank you,positive
"Dear team @quora, I have installed-uninstalled the app for more than 100 times but it is not working at all. As soon as you try to open quora, it says 'quora is not working ' and then we had two option, either cancel it or report the app. When I tried to click on 'report' then the phone screen turns black. Please solve this issue, I am very interested to use this app. Hope you will solve this problem soon... Thank you !",negative
"Since the last update the app sucks. For some reason they banned me for using a fake name (I am not! , although collecting real names is suspicious anyways), I tried changing my name to something random and then changing it back again to my name, which worked before, but now there was no result. Now I tried to use the moderation appeal feature, but every time I complete a form it crashes and displays ""Something went wrong"". I have perfect Internet and also tried in the browser with no luck.",negative
"Everything's fine, I love this app but the problem is it needs too much high speed internet despite there is almost no video or picture anybody upload in forums.",positive
"I opened up quora page and pop up kept on coming about downloading the app, even if I don't what to. Disappointed.",negative
"So you're telling me when I want to view a single page of yours in my browser, I have to be interrupted by an unclosable pop-up with two ""options"" - ""download the app"", or ""I already have the app"" both of which take you directly here to the official play store. Ok. Whoever was behind this idea: kindly go suffocate on a dick.",negative
"It takes 20 to 50 minutes to load. What's wrong with this app. My internet speed is fast, but then every time I open this app it start to slow. My other apps are doing goo, like facebook, instagram, youtube, chrome and more, it's just this app that takes forever to load.",negative
Very bad experience. It lags a lot. I have to close again and again and restart. Very shabby app.,negative
As a platform its elegent. But as an app its quiet unimpressive. The font size can't be changed . Still have no dark mode .,negative
The messenger was too slow and app is slow too. even sometimes I see nothing in my field even when I have full range .please fix it,negative
"I keep getting spammed by the amount of notifications this app gives me. I've had this app for around 7 months now, and only for the last few days it just constantly sends me suggested reads every 10 minutes, and I'm not even joking. It's really getting annoying now, especially because I want notifications now and again. I can find settings for email frequency, but not for notifications frequency. Please fix!",negative
"This app isn‚Äôt for low spec phones. Drains battery quickly, slows my phone down.",negative
"Slow connection to server, no split screen, simple application with high usage resources",neutral
"greate app. many good question and answer. However, We need a dark mode / night mode for this app.",positive
"It was running good before 3 months ago , i took break from it and when i installed again last week , i got problem like whenever i open any answer it shows only WRITER's on screen nothing else. No answer. So , basically i can just read questions and not answer. Do something , asap",negative
It's slow and unusable after the upgrade. Answer editing has gone choppy and mess.,negative
"Quora good but the only problem for me is that whenever I click the ‚Äúread more‚Äù to show the full answer of a Quoran, it will view a different answer and question for 10 seconds or more which is irritating for me. Another thing is that we aren't allowed to change our profile picture using our phones, in order to change it you have to open it to a desktop. I hope Quora would fix this so that I could give this app 5 stars, thank you.",negative
Made me download the whole app when I wanted to quickly check one thing on my phone. Sneaky practice. Deleted right after.,negative
"I would have rated higher but the site just wouldn't allow me to read. I am forced to install the app in order to use Quora. It got really frustrating at a point and I had to give in to the pop-ups. Please don't force us to install the app, it's a bad UX.",negative
"A great platform, but terrible app. Irresponsive, slow and a faulty touch detection.",negative
A new bug now! The notification section constantly disappears and reappears.,negative
"I think I've gained more knowledge here than in any other app... Definitely an app worth being on your smartphone üëçüëç Just one problem, it becomes slow after continuous use... I hope it can be solved.",positive
"If you ask me that how is the quora plateform i will say, no other plateform exist like quora. But if you ask me how me how is the quora app i would say very annoying. I wrote an answer 3 times, every time i upload a picture it brings me to my home screen and when i go back every thing get vanished. I need to type it again from the beginning. And when i open the notification it show for 2 sec then again refreshes and this goes on and on. Please resolve this issue.",negative
"This is my first review for any app in playstore. Quora is very good app and very informative. I learned so many new things from the answers for very good questions. But coming to the app, it is draining my phone battery. Every time when i open the app it take so much time to load the feed. And it makes my phone so hot that I didn't realised this for nearly two months. I uninstalled this app and it feels like a new phone, thanks for the app..:)",positive
This new update has made this app worse. Whenever i open newfeed the screen just starts flashing on its own. The screen turns white and i can't do anything about it.,negative
"Almost every time I am typing a response, the app crashes. One redeeming quality is that the app seems to auto-save what has been typed up to the point of crashing. I do like the formatting capabilites.",neutral
I loved the app but the last update is awful! The notifications page just refreshes every second and I can't click on any of them. Please fix it quickly.,negative
This app opens very slow and sometimes not even open. Please improve it in next update as early as possible.,negative
Not opening smoothly from search results or other apps. It will keep loading,negative
"The app is always having connection issue. There is no week that passes by without having problem of ""Can't connect to the Internet"".",negative
"Used Quora since early 2016, while credits were there, readers had really great content available but only limited users could answer sometimes. On removal of credits, huge influx of users started answering, initially it was great but gradually quality faded away. Immature questions, answers and bashing comments made things worse. Now all I see in Quora is politics, religious intolerance and unusual questions and answers just like a social media platform filled with toxicity.",negative
"I hate this company and app. They have a perfect functional website that forces you to download this terrible app to keep reading. Terrible app, terrible company.",negative
I really enjoy Quora. The stories are interesting. Nice to have another persons thoughts. Some wonderful writing. It,positive
I like the openess about literally every or any topic you can think of. App seems to run smooth not poppin upbon ya all the time neither!,positive
"I don't understand why this app can't be made better? There are so many complains, app is crashing, glitchy, not showing any pictures, slow to the point you want to scream....But on another side quora acting the same on my browser too. ( UC browser and Chrome) ( Android phone) I would love to use it, but after some days trying just give up.... Can't the experience of using it be improved? How other people use it? Maybe it just good working from PC? I don't know....",negative
Love the way it impacts the public. Makes us read and know more. A big turn down of quora is repetitive suggestions! It's algorithm creates an unhealthy toxic mirage of some topics which one would be interested. Keeps suggesting a singular theory/concepts instead of random or near random experience. Need an option to turn off personalised suggestion of quora q/a etc. Yet quora is knowledgeable,positive
Quora is a nice service but the Android app is annoying. Searching for something and clicking on a question/response often just gives me a blank screen. I don't understand why because looking at answers from my feed works flawlessly.,negative
"Really a great app! But there's two problems that I would like to be fixed. First, the apps a bit slow. Hope the team can fix that. Second, and most importantly, the maximum characters for asking a question is very less. When we need to get some answers to specific situations, we need to elaborate the situation. But the low maximum character limit doesn't let this work out. The maximum character limit should be atleast twice the limit that is right now. Hope you can help!",negative
Doesnt works well. It shows blank page when i tap read more. App has other issues too. Website version is best.,negative
"I have been using Quora from last few years. So from last few months I have been banned from Quora that I am not using my real name. I actually have tried to appeal against it alot of time before but everytime a window gets open mentioning-""Something Went Wrong"". This hasn't been fixed till now. Otherwise it's a good app.",negative
The is ok ... but it should come with more user friendly features as to have a dark theme in the anaroid version.,neutral
Soory to give u just a star but this app needs no star at all. It is the slowest app and keeps showing blank screens.,negative
Very frustrating application.it take so much time to load even i have a good internet connection but this app is running like I try to play gta 5 on 1 gb ram mobile and the app freeze after 2 minutes I don't know why the developers don't want to fix this application they just made and publish this app on playstore they won't try this app themselves and why the developers never reply to google play reviews,negative
This app gives a lot of opportunity to put your views but this is mostly left leaning organisation. Without any reason most of your good points will be removed by quora just because it hurt someone's sentiments. But never does the same for the other side.,negative
"Best, all the students looking for guidance definitely use it. People are there who share their experiences and believe me it's the best way to know things",positive
"If there are 2000 answers for a question and i have to read the 2000th answer, then i must go to next page and next page each and evey time to get to that answer. This really irritates. it would be better if I had the option for entering the page numbers of my interest.",negative
"I have gained a lot of knowledge from Quora, but I think they should screen and check put the answers because there are people who post false info on there. Honestly, when I downloaded it, I figured the answers came from actual professionals and people qualified to answer. Some cases that is true. Most cases, it is people's opinions and anyone can answer. I dont like that. I listened to a woman on there and it turned out she was wrong bc she didn't know what she was talking about.",negative
"Like reddit its an endless harrassment to get the app. Least with reddit you can actually look at stuff with out making a profile. Its stupid because both of them are usually some of the very first things on google search. You can view the first thing you look at on here but to go any further you need a profile. Then once you make a profile, you have to get the app or be bombarded with pop ups telling you how much better it is. Only difference, you dont get asked to get the app constantly.",negative
"Always a good place to find Many different opinions (some validated, mostly Not Tho!ü§£) you learn to just piece together your own version of ""Truth"" whatever that means",positive
The messaging section sucks on a different level. If there was a race between a tortoise and the quora messaging feature the tortoise would undoubtedly win. Also it should have the feature to not see a specific type of questions like screenshots.. But the application is very knowledgeable and engaging.,negative
"Why can't you guys bring back the old swipe up to reach news feed after I have read the answer. Mobile phones have become bigger, why are you restricting me to press at predefined places to go back to news feed. You are not even using the swipe feature. Why can't I swipe left or swipe up from an answer and reach the homepage? You guys seriously need a better product manager. I thought there will be something in this update but no. Nope. Nothing.",negative
"I never leave reviews, and I haven't even tried the app yet, but y'all trash for making me download the app when I should be able to view (maybe not unlimited, but not just one or two) answers on the site. Taking up memory space when I won't even use it like that. Ass.",negative

Always show no data connection although 4g connection work well in other app. my device Samsung a50. this App work with WiFi only. What is the problem Buddy?,negative
Why do you keep messing with the position of the back button? The exit X at the end of an answer is the perfect position for the back button. Arrow on the top left sucks.,negative
"I love the site, the app leaves a lot to be desired. Lately I'm having glitch issues. I can answer like one question maybe two before having to close and reopen the app. I've uninstalled it, updated it, tried logging out and back in, I've troubleshot 10 ways to Sunday!",positive
Main feed doesnt load even after refreshing multiple times. Happens most of the time.,negative

If I'm opening a link by signing in then why are you forcing to install the app in Android. This is not good. Please change this.,negative
Why force us to use quora app on android ? I don't like this forcing us to install app. Won't use quora. I am comfortable in using browser for surfing quora and not have another app of 5+ mb. Very bad quora for forcing users to install the app.,negative
I'm reducing the stars for very obvious reasons that others have already pointed out which is the prolonged issue of the app being too slow to open and render content. I prefer website to your app which is a shame. The website constantly nags me to install the app which I already have on my phone. Therefore I even disable the javascript temporarily as long as I browse the website.,negative

Hindi version needs lots of improvement as far as content is concern. quality is not upto the mark as compare to english version of Quora.,negative
"The app's notification system needs some fixing, and the interface is too laggy",negative
"Freezes unnecessarily, no dark mode even till now. Force people to install their app which does not even work properly.",negative
I recently downloaded the app and Screen suddenly froze while writing a comment. The keyboard stuck on screen and i had to restart the phone!,negative
"Actually i like the concept of Quora. I used this website for solving many doubts when I search in browser, so I like this, after that I downloaded this app. But it's home is really terrible, they do not showing the topics we followed on Quora in their home screen,but showing some unwanted question stuff recommendation on feed. In my case, I followed topics such International Politics, AI, IoT.. but what they are showing ? How your mom responded when she caught you while masterbaton? üò†üò†",positive
"Doesn't take our important question seriously. They keep asking to edit question to get the answer. Although question is very unique and doesn't answered before. So, if you want to play ""edit the question"" game and improve your skills to ask something in very unique way then you came to the right way ‚úåüèª",negative
"Why you are pushing for app, I just want to read q and a on webpage but getting pushed to download app and not allowed to read is headache",negative
"For the knowledge purpose it is great, you will get new opinion about things but it is very slow, sometime people get frustrated while using it. Some time they unnecessarily collapsed the answer, so they have to work on it.",negative
I am reducing my ratings to 2 stars because there are too many glitches and lags in the app that need to be fixed immediately.,negative
Worst aap.......quora app is very slow on even very good network speed it's taking so long time to open about 2- 3 min.and after that only it work for 2 min and then hang like hell.....are the developers of this app is learning to code... 0/5 to their unwanted useless updates of quora app.,negative
Very slow app. Sometimes answers are not added. Sometimes comments also not added. I am user of Quora since a year. Just resolve the issue of app. IMPORTANT: ADD DARK MODE IN APP,negative
"I don't want the app. I just want to keep using the website itself. PLEASE STOP INTERRUPTING MY EXPERIENCE ON THE SITE WITH A POP UP OF HOW MUCH BETTER THE APP IS, WHEN IT ACTUALLY IS NOT. And the pop up can't even be closed, I have to revisit the site every five seconds because- ""LOOK AT OUR APP INSTEAD. GO CHECK IT OUT!"" If you want us on the app instead, then take down the site. Let us know which one we're using.",negative
"If you want to further read the answer, it can't not open so you can not read it.Very few times it is open. Inspite of regular updation and high seed wi fi.i am facing such type of experience. Developers need to work on this.",negative
A great collection of wisdom and ideas and the point of view of people from one end of the spectrum to the other. Real-life wonderments with real life responses. just goes to show it takes all kinds to make a world.,positive
"The app keeps freezing, links stop working and it is annoying. Will be using the service through the browser like before.",negative
The app always shows redundant feeds and does not do a good job refreshing with new content. Always the same ads. They also restrict content and will not allow me to post questions or reviews due to the fact that they don't think my name matches my e-mail. Very restrictive of free speech.,negative
"I dont have room on my phone for the app, so it would be nice if the website didnt harass me to download it in order to view certain things. Edit: again, i wish you guys would shut up about me getting the app. There is absolutely no room for it on my phone. Let me browse in peace.",negative
"I love this app so much! Its my favorite social media platform and I find it very useful for whenever I have a question. Even the community is great! My only complaint is that the app is a bit slow. My internet is 4 bars and yet it takes abt 5 minutes for each page to load. I hope you get this issue fixed as soon as possible. Otherwise, I really recommned this app to everyone!",positive
"On the web site, a dialog blocks content I have been reading with a dialog box I can't dismiss: ""Download the app"" or ""I already have it"". Neither option dismisses the box. My answer? NEITHER. Uninstalling without reading the rest. Buh-bye.",negative
I like this app. The content is really great but the app is very slow. Literally only my feed loads. Everything else just does not load. So tragedy because of its slow speed I can barely use all its features,negative
"I prefer read Quora in the browser than in app for one reason: it's very slow to load the content. Annoyingly Quora will force you to read their content in app while reading in browser. Their contents are great, the app is BIG NO.",negative
"I love the site but please fix the app, sometimes I can't view the comments. There are many issues using it.",negative
"Absolutely horrific implementation of a great ideea. App crashes, freezes, deletes typed text, makes elaborate text impossible to write. At first it worked great; now with all the ""improvements"" I've uninstalled it on all but my newest phone, and might just kill it entirely. I don't care about visuals, I just want the darn thing to work. Good luck",negative
"The organization of the app is not very user-friendly, and starting off with all topic notifications on almost made me uninstall immediately. the straw that broke MY back was when I was attempting to edit my answer before posting, and it kept deleting letters and words. Then i selected everything in an attempt to copy so I could edit outside of the app? It just disappeared. Wasn't cut, or it would be on my clipboard. Beyond frustrating! if I return it will be via my browser...",negative
"Not working properly, failed to loading contents even at good internet speed, please fix this issue asap",negative
Slow and sluggish app.Takes years to load it just drowns your phone battery.The quora team does not care about your problem when you report the problem.,negative
The new update is horrible. I mean really horrible. It keeps on loading the comment section but doesn't show it.,negative
I would really appreciate it if a Dark theme is included. I use dark theme for all my major apps that support it. Thank you.,positive
So many problems ...there used to a time when this app worked smooth now cant even read an answer as it gets stucked everytime ..,negative
Loved the informative content. Hated the 186% battery use. Had to uninstall so my battery would last the day again.,positive
Very informative and awsome experience in this application. ..and some of the memes page is to good ..... And also lots of information,positive
"No words to describe awesomeness of this app, using since last 6 years. Just one drawback/issue found - cannot copy any external link present in the answer.",positive
"So addicted, many people always give an explanation with a good source and sometimes based on their experience.",positive
Sometimes the app is way too irritating. It takes forever for the answers to load.will review my rating once the UI problems i m facing goes away. Cant read half the answers.,negative
"I never got to the app, was always on the last step, always just had to pick 10 more topic... After the 4th time picking the last 10... Never again",negative
I don't know what happened after the latest update. It started crashing every 2 minutes!,negative
This app is great! I have learned so much things I never knew existed in our world! For the most part people are pretty respectful of others feedback and friendly!,positive
Made by tortoise. What kind of app is this very slow and can't load quickly even if it is text. Need serious improvement.,negative
"You force to download the app while surfing through browsers. üëéüëéüëé Let you that pop up down. Those, interested will download themselves.",neutral
"I like using this app, you can learn very useful & important facts & news and almost every thing whats going on in this world. But now a days not a singles answer is opening although i have a very good internet speed. I hope Quora fix this soon.",positive
Is forced on me if I want to keep reading something on my smartphone. I used to have the app but it takes up a lot of space which I don't have spare. While I appreciate the forum I dislike being FORCED to install after 10 minutes into an thread by developers who can't be bothered to be device memory friendly.,negative
Got interesting topic notification from quora but everytime can't even load the page and now can't even load the homepage. Team developer absolutely need to do loads of work here to repair this broken apps,negative
"The app fluctuates a lot. It takes lot of time to load the pages. I have been trying to change my profile picture, but it does not change.",negative
"Overall I like this app - I've lost a fair amount of time going down various rabbit holes, but it seriously drains my battery.",positive
"I love using quora and reading over various content for hours the problem i m facing is i have a ipad and i use the quora app over there most of the time and when open in my phone the web version of it always ask me to install the app, i mean this is not a good thing to it feels like you are forcing your app to use",positive
Information wise its excellent. Why does it has to freeze for every time I try to open something,positive
"When I want to escape from my own life, I turn to Quora. Sometimes I feel blessed, other times I feel entitled and every once in a while I feel humbled.",positive
It is very disappointing. Many of my answers have been collapsed for complete vague reasons. Recently another one was collapsed it was written 3 years ago! After getting more than 32k+ views now you guys see it is violating some policy. I just took a quote from somewhere while the majority of the answer was the work of my own creativity. Plus it's been 3 years how can someone remember the source. Do you guys remember what breakfast you had 3 years ago? Totally Deserving of the 1* rating.,negative
I love the interaction and reading the questions as well as reading the different answers.,positive
"Very helpful platform, whenever i have a question or doubts, i just get my answers. This is my favourite social media platform.",positive
In every two or three answer a window of spaces pops up and it's REALLY REALLY ANNOYING. Why don't developers use the app before the deploy it,negative
First thing I tried to google a question and the Quora website was the first answer that popped up so I clicked on the answer and it wasn't even able to see my answer after 5 seconds it redirects you to download then app. So much for being fast and convenient...,negative
It is a good app but it is not responding after I updated it. Also it crashes often. Please fix it.,negative
Most of the app is fine but I am writing this review because the compose message box is so laggy and that seems like the most important component of the app. I have a new phone and it heats up on the compose message screen and the cursor and response slows down considerably. It did it on my last phone too. Needs to be fixed!,negative
These days this app is irritating the hell out of me! This app lags so bad and the answers dont even load no matter how long i wait for them to load. Earlier the app used to be the best and i used to spend a lot of time on it but if the app continues to suck so bad i would eventually have to uninstall it. I have given it 2 stars just for the great answers i get to read on it but overall my experience with the app is not very pleasant right now.,negative
It's efficient comparing to other Apps and sites. Totally good to use . The users are friendly,positive
App needs a lot of improvement.. Opening up a post takes hell lot of time.. Even with a great connection..,negative
Why do I need to download the app to read the contents when you post it in the Google search? Is it that only if its downloaded then only you will allow people to chk out the questions?? Then a very poor strategy.. puts off people who want to do a search to find the answers and not fill up the space in their smartphones ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ,negative
I have never seen a website like yours that forces people to download it's app to be able to read something it sucks and makes me hate it or you're trying to show us that you have alot of money you don't care now you need to fix this not everyone who visit your website need your app some may be looking for a once off info,negative
Content is great. Forcing me to download the app after making the web experience impossible to view without constantly telling me to download the app and blocking content... not so great. So I downloaded it just to see one article and give this mediocre rating. What's the point of a webpage if you force people to get the app? Losers.,negative
Giving it 1 star without when trying it out as the website won't let me browse on my phone and forcing me to install this app. There's no need to download app for everything. This sucks.,negative
It's a great place to find like-minded people and personally relatable topics. Make the Lite version please. I want to update this comment and say THANK YOU Quora for the new font! Update 2020 the same issues persist. It's so heavy to load and space consuming. Please pay attention to this issue thank you,positive
"Earlier quora used to be a place to get good knowledge, but now its same questions repeatedly asked or the suggestion algorithm sucks. On top of it now more and more ads are desguised as posts and its annoying. Instead make it a paid service.",negative
"Sir it's server error or what ,when I open everything it's takes more than 10 seconds to open until shows a white loading page which irritates me show any solution",negative
Really this is amazing app....it solve my all problem related to study and life....i love to spend time on quora rather than Instagram or any other social media...,positive
Forced to download a less functional app than the mobile page used to be while viewing from phone. Site is great but the forced app download is atrocious,negative
App is informative but it is bit slow and non responsive. It became irritative when we open question and it does not open.,negative
I was forced to download the app to continue using the site on mobile. Now I have another app taking up space on my phone when I would have preferred to use the browser. Thanks a lot.,negative
"This version very slow and sticky , cant load perfectly , app should be smooth and dynamic",negative
"I can use Quora spanish normally through my browser, but when i want to use Quora English in the browser they force me to install the app by blocking me from watch the content of the answers... they are on their rights but they should let us choose if we want the app or use the web version, i mean, in the Spanish version this doesn't happens.",negative
This app has became a sick blogging app like others!! There are only sick questions!! Relevant to film industries and other controversial issues!!,negative
Ever since the last few updates the app takes hell lot of time to load. Even on my Nokia 8.1.,negative
I am unable to change my profile picture as it automatically rotates my picture to the right! Whats going on Quora Team?? Very poor user interface also üòï Not satisfied with the app.,negative
It answers your all questions. Very useful app... specifically for education purpose.,positive
"This app is amazing, I mean you can find all topics to discuss about, I personally learned alot of things that helped me see the world clearly. I would recommend this app for everyone interested in finding the answers answered by specialised people",positive
"I love quora, but the app is awful. Lots of crashes and bugs. Most of the time it will not let you submit answers after writing them. Avoid the app. Quora forces the app download, refuse it and goto desktop mode instead. It just does not work, if it did i might use, ive tried 4 times on 3 different devices.",negative
"Stupid. I shouldn't have to download an app i have no use for when i should be able to read online. Especially when the app is slow, crashes, and screws you over when you're answering. It's been a problem and apparently they don't want to fix it. Read what i wanted to then immediately uninstalled. Fix it to stop bothering people to get your app. Unprofessional in my opinion",negative
"Quora is good platform for knowledge sharing and knowledge gaining. Nowa days , the quality of questions asked has dropped down drastically. People asks questions whose answers are either known or can be found easily. So now Quora has become ordinary platform.",negative
"This is a great platform/ application to use our knowledge. We can share our thoughts, views or our experience with others and even can get help if we need. This will help us in many ways.",positive
"Quora is a good app, but the FONT of answers is small, they creates pressure on eyes while reading. Please, give an option in app settings to Adjust ""FONT"" in next app update. I will change my ratings to 5Star ratings after you resolve this issue. Thanks in advance.",negative
"Even it doesnt presented with good UI, but at least you still be able to operate the app.",neutral
"Very horrible app, when am going through my feeds and click to read an answer it just shows a blank screen... how are we to use the app if it's not showing anything... worse thing you guys don't even reply people's complaints here...",negative
"Seriously? I can't just read on the web? Do I HAVE to install the app to read stuff? I had to UNINSTALL it a few days ago because it was consuming too much data and battery. I don't know what people think, just because you have an app it doesn't mean I want to use it, I just want to read my digest on web! Not shove my phone with everyone's apps, it's not like I have the ultimate phone with all the storage and battery I need, my phone is ""old"" now!",negative
"Fantastic amount of very, very helpful info, easy at your fingertips. Great work.",positive
"Garbage. Login function is mostly broken. Opening any page bounces the interface all over the place. Worst of all, their website forces you to use the app eventually.",negative
Totally addicted to this one. Have come across some really amazing articles and people through this app. Not a day goes by without opening this.,positive
"This app was one of the finest, but the recent updates have made it lag soo much that it is nearly impossible to load the answers... please fix it ASAP",negative
"Not the app, but the company . first they force you to make an account if you want to read an answer on their website. After you do that you have to install their app, and then follow 10 spaces. Piss off!",negative
Good UI and nice informative app Edit in 2020: The app gets crappier every day. Most repellent app that was once so famous. Uninstalled and will never use again.,negative
Forcing users is the reason this will always be a small time app. First you forced advertisements on users. Loads of it. Then there's Quora moderation that's nothing short of unsolved mystery. And now forcing everyone to download app...,negative
"üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéI don't wanna give a single star, it's just for writing review because This application is really disgusting and f***ing bad, does not work properly, close by its own and hanging taking much time to load content. Worst app please don't download and waste your time. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé",negative
"The text editor is pathetic, and app is also slow. Sometimes it just loads and loads even at strong Internet connection.",negative
Its really useful.But it would be helpful if some changes are taken and update to get more facilities and fix lag problem.,positive
"Very annoying to actually write an answer. Texting field is so buggy, by the time I type a sentence it randomly moves the sentence upward into the middle of a different paragraph. Also the push ads online to get the app is way too pushy.",negative
"I would give this more stars, but I came across a glitch (or what seems like a glitch). I never asked or replied to comment inappropriately, so it was quite surprising when I got a notification that my account was banned, because of violention of community guidelines. I have been nothing but respectful when giving advice to others and in my personal questions. Thanks for taking this into consideration and good luck in your future projects.",negative
"App is amazing, except few are not working in android! Things working - opening app, browsing through feeds and sharing Things not working: upvote, down vote, comments, check others comments! App is up to date, help me with this. Thank you.",positive
I've used Quora for years. 2014. I've earned top writer. Unfortunately the latest version of.the Quora app crashes when i try to answer a question off the answer tab on the Android app. Sad. Reported. Happening for weeks.,negative
I read Quora more than virtually every other written medium. You really need NIGHT MODE! 07/07/20 - You've finally added it! I will no longer be blinded when reading in bed.,positive
"I've been searching this kind of app in my life! This is very good app, can add insight from the experienced person",positive
"It is a little more reliable because it lets you answer the questions according to your experience, degree, certification or profession. But it takes a while sometimes to get an answer if you ask a question. I or 2 days or weeks.",neutral
"Typing questions and answers is a nightmare. Theres a glitch when asking or answering a question where if you type too fast it auto fills words (random words) in between letters while you're typing. It's also extremely slow while typing, like it's trying upload every letter as you're typing. It takes 20 to 30 times longer to answer a question (no exaggeration).",negative
"I love this app, it's so useful but has two problems. First it's too slow to open the answers, and second it's hard to write and send a message to people; because everytime it takes too long to open a new page to write the message and same to receive a message from person.",negative
"I thought this will give me the feed which I like and what I want to follow . But everytime I am just seeing bollywood related things which I don't want to see , and I express it too by clicking the cut options . And I have shown my areas of interest but those don't appear on home page . I hope they fix this .",negative
Edit: Just changed my review to 5 stars now on 7th July 2020 after Dark mode arrived on Android 8. Old review: I need dark mode for Android 8. That's it. Ok one more thing. Let me save the images i see in answers like fb and twitter. It becomes easy and takes less space. Edit : Still there is no dark mode. I as a developer am volunteering to do it for you if you engineers are so bad.,neutral
"No images are visible,not even my own dp.Anything in colour is not visible.Only the black letters are visible that to with slow loading",negative
"Sometimes there comes a problem while I use the app. The phone gat hanged. I think there might be some problem with my mobile. But still I am not sure is this because I use the app. Otherwise, it's very informative.",negative
I am glad the dark mode came into existence but it loads slower when I open the app even when the network is good. Hope you resolve the issue sooner,neutral
I've been using this app since quite a long time. And it's really good. Sometimes people do ask stupid questions but doesn't matter there will be someone always to answer those questions too. I like reading articles too. So yep it's a good app. ‚úåÔ∏è,positive
"Quora has basically become a trash heap, hard to recommend to anyone anymore that they check it out. Paying people to ask questions and idiotic moderation has tanked the platform. I'm still around for now, but I don't write answers anymore, it's a waste of time. If you are just learning and willing to put in the time to train the algorithm and find good people to follow, it will be worth it. My general knowledge has grown a lot in the few years I've been a member. Hope things will improve.",negative
"DARK MODE IS REALLY BAD. i wonder who worked on this dark mode.its really bad everything is messed up.no visual hierarchy,no white space. Everything is stuffed without any thought.",negative
"Worst experience ever. This app is lagging, Hanging and it works slow üò° Developers Should be Corrected on next update !",negative
The problem with this app is that I have to tap the plus sign button multiple times just to have the add a question section pop up.,negative
Good to find personalised responses and sometimes fake marketing oriented ones. Use your descretion.,neutral
The app is too laggy and slow respond. Also the design should be more simple to making more user friendly and easy to use.,negative
The app is hanging on initial startup.. please do something... And don't force the users to use your app in mobiles.. we use our data on browsers why do you force us to download your app... Please do anything... It's still hanging...,negative
"Usuaully just want a quick read on a question, yet the mobile website refuses to allow reading and forces app use. Typically if I have a specific question I put it in Google and start looking for a decent answer. I don't want to be forced to use a different app from the already accessible Google search bar on my home screen. Y'all wanna have an app that's fine, but you also have a website and I should be able to choose which to use.",negative
when i press into the post the content do not appear just blank and only show the profile of the person,neutral
"Considering the view the app is really good but it has also some major problems that are disrupting me.First it is very slow,I have to wait like a dozen of seconds waiting for the thing I clicked for...Second it does not show you how the app work when you are a beginner for this app.You really have to make some improvements and upgrades.",negative
Website is better than using mobile application. Its using too much cpu in my mobile and slow loding comparing to website.,negative
Earlier we could change 'spaces' from home screen but after the update not possible they removed it. They are asking for a genuine name.,negative
"It's good for getting answers and answering questions, but I'm not giving it a five because there is too much clutter all around the app and it not easy to use. But otherwise it's great",positive
"A fairly good app, but I would like to receive all notifications on responses to my comments which I seem to be unable to do in the settings.",positive
I am not going to install your app. I can read the questions and answers just fine in my browser. And every time the ad for your app pops up I will close the entire thing and read no further.,negative
Interesting app for conversing about any questions or subject. Normal everyday people share their understandings and experiences.,positive
"My tablet hasnat been running properly since I have downloaded quora. The subject that I chose to speak on, I was somehow removed from answering the questions on the subject. I'm guessing becuz I did not agree with the majority of the questions that were asked, obviously the majority wins. So what I have come to conclude is that if you want to voice your negative opinion, don't sign up. They do not respect your opinion. If you want to join to read life stories, it's good. I want out.",negative
"This is a kind of worst app ever developed..it takes too long to load..For a useful and interesting idea this kind of background team makes useless, better use chrome version it's far and far better than app",negative
"Quora has been too invasive with having to make an account to browse the forums after a certain point and being forced to download the app from the mobile browser version by a modal that has no option for closing, either you've already downloaded the app which takes you to the app or to the play store if not, or you didn't which takes you directly to the play store",negative
You cannot zoom on pics and graphs where it is necessary. Poor experience. I receive too much suggestions for stupid questions asked by Americans full of preconceived ideas about EU and the rest of the world.,negative
The app has a problem with playing videos...it is very slow despite my high speed internet connection.,negative
Too many glitches in the app making the whole experience cumbersome. Photos take a lot of time to load. Expanding the answers is very unresponsive and slow.,negative
"The app's performance is pathetic, This rating is purely on technical perspective..about the mobile app..Quora as a platform is 5/5 always",negative
Too many bugs which make it impossible to use this app. Every day new bug crops up. How many times we are supposed to report bugs?,negative
If someone doesn't have any guidance regarding something then this app is for you... Great app!! Thank you for launching this app. This is very useful for me.,positive
It used to work well. But now it doesn't even open. I tried around 6-7 times and nothing happens. I even tried after restarting my phone.,negative
"Frustrating, problems started as soon as i moved to dark mode. Not able to open the app at all. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, clearing all the data but nothing helps.",negative
"My internet connection is always good, but the application itself take a long load when I refresh the home tab. Also, I got error when I want to read an answer more (it became lag). Could you please fix it? I think the problem is on the application itself, not from my internet connection :)",negative
"The app is not working properly, it keeps crashing again & again I'm uninstalling the app and again installing it from play store again & again. Kindly fix this bug in app",negative
The emails are SO annoying and I uninstalled the app and they still come and can't stop them.,negative
"Typing glitches and lags... I wouldn't think typing should be a particularly computation intensive task, yet typing on Quora is one of the laggiest experiences on my phone. Doesn't make sense honestly.",negative
The app is not opening since a few days...and this is happening frequently... please fix this.,negative
It's impossible to find out how to read a question and it's answers. There are plenty of articles and videos on what Quora can do but there's no support available for anyone who's struggling with the basics. I just wish my search engine would stop referring me to Quora where I inevitably experience a frustrating waste of time.,negative
I dont know why but i installed it a few days back first two days it worked well but from 3DAYS its not opening and showi g web page not available,negative
App losing it's credibility with constant technical glitches. I am unable to open this app atleast for once today due to glitch.,negative
I hv downloaded it more than 20 time with a hope that now it may not get slow. .but it always got hang..and its function is vry slow,negative
"I don't know what has happened after the update, it doesn't reload even after uninstalling several times!!",negative
It doesn't work at all. I updated the app and restarted my phone as well. But it just can't load on my phone. So bye for now.,negative
The problem I encountered in this app is while searching anything in a web browser..I come across any link to the Quora answer...it's doesn't gets me to the answer...the app stops working and the answer even doesn't loads to my local browser...so just had no option but to uninstall it,negative
Although a good app... But it's very very slow and keeps hanging day after day... Which is annoying and killing the interest!!! Seems like time to make a shift to other apps!!!,negative
"Too many ads. It used to be a intellectual and knowledge pool, not its full of political trolls.",negative
I would rate it 0 stars if I could. It is so annoying. I only downloaded the app because I had to in order to see the rest of an important answer.,negative
"You are forcing us to use app. While your own app doesn't work correctly 90% times. I can't go back, I can't see my spaces, read more links are broken, etc. Either fix your asap or let us use the website.",negative
It's one of the best apps in playstore but it keeps on crashing. Please fix the bug asap.,negative
Unable to access the feed. It goes into never ending loading. Please look into it.,negative
"I use Quora website & the amount of information you can get form such sites is humongous which I really appreciate. But it just stops there because the application is just ridiculous, pathetic, garbage what not. No matter what network I'm on, be it Wi-Fi or cellular connection this application just won't open & load the feed. But the same pages when opened on the website works like charm.",negative
"This is a nice platform to share your knowledge,information and opinions but there became a issue after updating the app. A connection error falls when I open the app.",negative
Quora wont load. It says connection timed out after waiting for 5 mins. Connection is good as other apps are working fine.,negative
The app is really good n i enjoy using in very much but the only prblm is that even when there is a good internet connection it works slow...which is damn irritating. Otherwise its just brilliant,positive
Always loved Quora but the app is so glitchy. It lags a lot whether you're reading or writing answers.,negative
Not working since last 2 days. Updated to latest version and cleared cache - still doesn't load,negative
"This app gives u huge information regarding every question u ask.it motivates a lot .but from 2 days iam unable to open this .as the app is saying 'no internet connection',but I have an high speed internet access! Donno the reason behind this , except that every thing is working great!!!!",positive
This is the worst update of all time. Upon clicking the answers do not open instead it takes forever to load them.,negative
Update : Downgrading the rating as the app has become lot slower theses days. One place to learn and gain wisdom,negative
"Some times it just blank not showing anything on home or notification, this stars for developers not for content I also admit that it is user friendly but from past 2 days it sucks",negative
"Yes..... I rated single star to quora. Be patiently I'm doing that. I switch on to quora very curiously, But Damnnnn it's always keep loading , Nothing is seen to there except that three dots.",neutral
App version 3.0.2 updated on 8 July 2020. App closed automatic after 5-10 minutes. Please solve it,negative
Quora suddenly stopped working. Even with high speed network it isn't loading. I just see black screen and nothing happening on refresh.,negative
Problem with the app whatever is being asked is not shown in the app rather it home question and scrap is being shown.. no need of app website serves better,negative
"App won't open. When the app is not even starting, how will it crash. Though I'm sure once it opens, it would crash. I was expecting certain things from Quora. Unfortunately, it seems like Quora is just another app which has not been developed properly.",negative
Yesterday I just updated this app. I used to love this. But after updating this app I felt I made huge mistake. App become worse than before. I tried to re download this app but I think I'm gonna lose interest if situation like this continues I would uninstall this app.,negative
"The idea of quora is amazing But the app sucks , it keeps crashing and even the user experience is not that good . And for the last 2 days the app isn't working for me.",negative
Now Most of the time this app not opening after reinstall. it takes time to open it show retry even after my net was working and also even i updated them,negative

Good app for knowledge but I have posted something which is not shown and from last two days it's not working showing the msg that webpage is not available,negative
"I was trying to read an article from Quora site on my mobile browser yet I was forced to download the app to read forward. Since I do not possess enough storage, to continue my reading I had to uninstall some apps. Bad move quora...",negative
"Great concept but has major problems. When accessing from email/web, it has glitches where sometimes it doesn't save your answers and where you can't see what you're writing. When trying to log in after forgetting password, it requires you to do the 'click all the boxes that have a ___' thing. Once you use the link that was securely emailed to you, reading the string of letters and numbers in an unusual unique font would be much easier and more secure mathematically--why not use that instead!?",negative
Its good except for the fact that from last couple of days the app is unable to load feed showing network error.,negative
"Is it possible to murder an application?! Because that's how frustrating this app is. I am guessing you guys who developed it realised it too, and have since been MIA, not fixing anything, just sitting there being failures. Pathetic interface, remove this app off the store and save us our time, do it for the sake of humanity, no wants a broken app, if you can't deliver then please do not bother at all.",negative
"The worst user experience a product has to offer. If I want to open a link on the website, I WANT TO OPEN IT ON THE WEBSITE. PERIOD. I don't want to download an app and sign in to an account.",negative
"Quora is the most intrusive platform I've ever come across. Feels like borderline malware. Giving them my email was a huge mistake. Inbox is flooded with nonsense that I never asked for and the one ""thread""/question I actually found interesting literally forced you to install the app just to see it. Signing up with my email and logging in on their website was not enough. Showed the slightest bit of interest and they railroad you at every turn. Awful practice. Will be uninstalling immediately.",negative
It was working good earlier. But now quora is not responding. I cleared all data and cache data. Uninstall it twice and when I installed it again. Still the problem exist. Its not at all responding. Plz fix this issue. I really love quora!,negative
"App stopped working, blank white loading screen when opened. I really don't wanna give 1star rating, please fix it.",negative
"Surely loves this app. It's like a social media but you're just ask/answer any question. I prefer Quora to any other social media such as youtube or Instagram since it only needs little internet quota. But the ""Back"" icon on the top left doesn't work. Hope you guys gonna repair it",positive
A once great app - It has been trying to load since the last 5 mins...I have done everything..cleared the cached..restarted the app..and mind you I am able to stream HD content..but quora does not load!.. üôÑ,negative
"After last update, it's not working properly. Having issues opening it despite good Internet connection and phone with 8gb RAM. plz fix it as soon as possible.",negative
Very badly designed... pressing back button takes you to the main page rather than previous question...takes forever to load the answer when diverted from chrome..,negative
App is really very slow . It ain't opening any of the answers for very long time.,negative
App is not working properly. Worst condition after update. Its loading and loading after some time it's shows web page is not available,negative
I was keen to this app..its perfect for taking and sharing knowledge and information .but it is disappointing now as it doesnt working properly ..it's so slow and keeps choking my phone .i cant ques and answer properly ..even the feed takes time to load . plz cure it asap.,negative
App is great.... But after latest update it is taking too much time to load and gets timeout. Need to try 3 to 4 times by clearing it's cache memory. Kindly fix this issue.,negative
Since the recent update the app has started taking very long time to load. Please fix the issue as soon as possible.,negative
"Over all, it is a great application...but it crashes almost every time I post something, whether it is a comment or an answer.",negative
"no option to copy, find word or select anything. The pages are not loading in the app , want to give zero star.",negative
"Finally we got the dark mode, but one issue that has not been resolved is the connectivity issue, idk if its your servers or my network but it works really slow even when there is no pictures to view in the article, just words take a long time to load, I hope you guys fix this, I belive that Quora is the best app ever made for smartphones.",negative
Good app but there's something that make me can't verified my account and sinc with my phone number even I tap the button but I don't know why it can't respond anything. Please fixed it.,negative
Keep crashing for no reason. But the low rating is not because of that but it blocks the user from viewing any posts at all unless it is updated to the latest version. Why can't I view the posts from older version of this app? I can't keep updating this app all the time. It's an inconvenience.,negative
They have the worst design possible in the history of human civilization. Not letting browse 2nd question without logging in? That's the most cheap and abominable way to get the user sign in. Absolutely disgusting.,negative
"Quora is an undeniably amazing app. I love the idea of sharing our thoughts and listening to others'. Whenever I feel lost and misguided, I always reach out to Quora community. That makes me feel I'm not alone in this world.",positive
not at all fast .. this is too slow and also If I am reading in google i.e. in website it suddenly stops and asks weather if I have downloaded it and after downloading I cant find the thing which I am reading in website.,negative
"This app blockes me from using it for literally no reason, because the notification didn't even tell me why, I definitely don't recommend",negative
"Not a knowledge sharing platform anymore. Annoying ads, links and copy paste are a big trouble. Original content has become extinct. To add more trouble, downloading the app is now compulsory, you cannot scroll in your browser.",negative
Quora is very nice and informative. But the app is crashing very often. Please look into the issue.,negative
I loved reading answers of different questions on this app but later it banned me for writing answer and asking questions and when I tried to fix it .....it shows errors everytime I tried that's why I won't be giving this app even one star but I had to,negative
"After this post, if nothing is done, I will uninstall the app. Reason: When I tap on the notification, it will take me to a blank page with nothing to show. I have a better use for my data!",negative
This app is enlightening in its dissemination of knowlegde. But very slow in turning up the answer page required or doesn't respond on time. Please see to its improvement.,negative
I am forced to download the app as the site when opened on browser is not letting me read the content and forcing me to download the app. This is keeping the user on ransom for a free service like Quora. Not fair.,negative
"Your app is BS, its total trash, I want to use it but its frustrating, It doesn't load answers, its UI is total garbage. TRASH TRASH TRASH.",negative
I love this app a lot personally i.like reading a lot and always very interesting to read something new this app provides a huge big platform to readers like me to read a üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,positive
"The forum itself is absolutely amazing but the app has some seriously annoying issues, like misinterpreting where you click sometimes and takin you to a different place than you clicked; also when typing anything it does this super weird thing where it jumbles up the letters randomly in the autocorrect, and you cant stop it, then you have to go back & completely rewrite what you've written. Other than that tho i like it",negative
"Not so different from webpage,except that disturbing ""open in app"" pop up. I used to put quora website on homepage but they consistently demanded to download the app. I downloaded app only to avoid it. And they providing nothing more.",negative
"The Quora website forced me to first make an account, I did, then I was forced to download their app. All in order to view the page I wanted to view. Surely an account is enough? This is especially frustrating when someone needs to view critical information and this delays that process / puts someone off altogether.",negative
Even if my data speed is over 1mbps then also this app took wayyy tooooo long to open . Such a pathetic speed it got.,negative
App is toooooo slow... I have click many time to open specific part. It's good on website.,negative
Good app and I enjoy the content but the app is not very user friendly...it is very difficult to open an answer and when I click on an answer it opens the next one...sometimes it does not work properly at all....it is also very difficult to close answer and upvote ....app frequently becomes extremely slow and sometimes it also lags,negative
"Worst app. Slow app. I thought it will be very useful to have an app like Quora which will help me in resolving problems. But i was wrong, this is one of the most slow and worst app in terms of operating and browsing. If the Quora's person seriously pay concern to their user than i would suggest them to improve their app and provide us a better and faster version of Quora not this third class build-up quality useless app.",negative
"Don't call anyone bitter, that is against the rules. Also glitchy and most of the content isn't very good.",negative
I'm active member of quora (Marathi). but uninstall it because of poor response of app. App developer should resolve these technical issues very soon.,negative
"It doesn't show when was a question asked nor there is any option of sorting them on the basis of time, number of people who are following that question, etc. The app lacks so many features, the app is really very slow considering all one has to upload/download is mostly texts",negative
"I should have given it a 5 star cos the app is great,i've learnt alot from it,it as positively improve my life,but i reserved the 2 star because it is very slow,even when ran on Andriod version 10.",positive
"Now this is getting really irritating !!! Everytime I close the Quora app tab while writing and I open it, it completely restart from the home then I have to go in draft to write it. Many times when I'm writing something, it hangs completely ! I have to cut the app and restart from the beginning. The keyboard problem is even worse, even after I back up the app, while it is hanging, the keyboard still remains on my phone's home üò†. This is getting worse than worse, you really need to fix it üò†",negative
Give us the old quora back ! It's the hero who has lived long enough to become the villan now. The new update is so annoying with all the irrelevant feeds scattered throughout my wall whenever I open the app,negative
A pleothera of information which encompasses all the personal verified and genuine stories and data regarding various issues. One can refer this app for clearing his doubts and if further doubts are to be cleared you may ping the author for personal advice and stuff. A very simple and great app in this sophisticated world.,positive
"It's a bit tedious sometimes, and honestly I prefer the mobile website, but this app works well enough now that there's a dark mode.",neutral
"I don't understand why I had to download this just to read something you already gain money from from the ads anyways. Money greedy, opinionated, and basic.",negative
"Reading on web redirects me to download this app to continue. I downloaded it and it barely even works. A lot of times they will just show blank screen everytime I click on something. It's just a bad app all around and not so convenient. If you want to force me to use the app, at least be a decent app first.",negative
"Fantastically Great idea, it just opens a new way of thinking, best platform to learn from people's experience. I loved it. üòäüòäüëçüëç",positive
Many things I have learn from this application. It is very useful for me to go through many Thia that I have never scene before.,positive
It is slow i don't know why developers are not working on it . It takes more buffering time otherwise it is good app,negative
The moderation team is very superficial even though one complies with Be nice be respectful they behave like artificial gods who don't see things with or without context app experience is bad even with latest updates and high speed broadband,negative
Very good app to keep oneself updated in many different fields. I always check this app for more information I want in particular area and find many latest updates.,positive
I think it is functioning quite okay ... I really love this application ... It has been really very much useful for me whenever I needed help of it,positive
I had this app since 2016 and have so far no issue I learn many things from this platform which is good for me and everyone there are tones of topic which are directly share from person life experience or you can share yours too,positive
"This is the world's best app to know everything about all the information contained in it, everything you want u can get it in here so many people are there to answer your question, believe me you will get to know so many going around you from this app and better than the general knowledge if you follow this app frequently. I've got to know there is so much going on everywhere and everything and I've learnt so much from it",positive
Keeps collapsing the answer without a reason. I didn't recieve a single notification !,negative
"The app is awesome but bit slow while loading post, no matter what the internet speed is, sometimes its show 3 post only and sometime it show error. There are lot of bugs in this application, takes lots of time while loading post from the feed, i also send problem to quora developer team but they are bit slow in reaching us and no reply from that side, so the idea of developing quora application is good but more important how you present your idea to users, their server is slow or bug in app idk",negative
"The app is good but I only have it because I cannot view anything from the chrome version on my phone without it directing me to download the app, which is a great disadvantage as I hate having too many apps on my phone that I know I will only use a few times",negative
"App idea is good but interface needs a huge testing and improvement . With current features, Someday this will be replaced by other app",neutral
"I dont have room on my phone for the app. Personally then information is great, its that the constant nagging to install the app turns me off.",negative
The app gets less usable with every update. It's a mess now. Not helped by the fact that it's now an Indian app.,negative
"While there's some interesting content here, unfortunately it's a breeding ground for troll's and the site isn't regulated very well.",negative
"The app is good. but, I have a suggestion. Can you guys make a dark mode UI? it'll be nice. I opened Quora before I am going to sleep, and I'm sure most of the others do the same thing. Edited: Now, we have the dark mode. Thanks!",positive
This is a great way to kill time by reading or writing answers. Those that want to practice their writing or reading of English can easily do so here.,positive
"I love Quora on the phone, but lately it's consistently crashing or forces my screen to go completely black. Writing on this app has become a nightmare, with the cursor moving up the post. It also freezes for 3-30 seconds before allowing you to continue typing. Or if you try to delete a word, that sometimes becomes a whole other nightmare. Thankfully its pretty good at saving drafts considering how often it glitches.",negative
I love Quora but the app freezes up my phone. I've tried it twice before and I've uninstalled the app an d won't consider downloading the app again,negative
"Interesting informations & many things we can get to learn, gain knowledge, new ideas also facts,etc & also we can share our views ideas which may help others... üòä useful appüëçüëçüëç",positive
"Annoying asf and horrible layout. Also, there's barely anything that's actually worth reading.",negative
"starting with the very slow loading process in the app, everytime i open a question it takes forever before it shows the answers, i updated the app and still the same problem!! Meanwhile when i use my browser on my phone it loads faster in instant!! Which leads to the other problem, Quora restricts me with a VERY annoying way from continuing my browsing at (THEIR PLATFORM!!) Just beacause they claim i don't have the app even though i do!! I just love using it with browser because it loads faster",negative
It's so poorly optimised that after 10 minutes of using the darn app i have to relaunch because it became to slow. I don't know what these developers are up to but it's nothing good.,negative
"Cannot open Quora on the app on Infinix Hot 6 as directed from my mail. Yet, I am forced to open with app each time I want to open with browser. Result is app takes forever to initialize, showing only blank page. Gushhh. Zero (0) rating as far as I am concerned.",negative
"Worst...i installed the app for about 15 times and each time it shows me that there in no internet connection, but i have then a high speed connection,and i am sure about it. ü§®üò°üò†",negative
"It is a great app but every time I write my answers Nowadays it is not visible to anyone , I asked my friend that if my answer is visible or not she refused so I have to delete the answer again and write again but then again it is not visible ..please fix this.",negative
"This used to be reliable. Every time I try to use it, it randomly clears the window and says ""connection lowhen I'm just idle and reading, regardless of my strong wifi. When it's actually showing content I can Airplane mode with no interruptions and continue reading what's on screen. So when there's no connection it will chill and let me finish reading. But when there actually is a connection it wipes the screen and just says ""retry connection. "" What agenda does this uodate pertain to?",neutral
This is a hell now... Everything seen on the screen is in Tamil. I twice u uninstalled. No it's not a mistake. I cannot use it again. Uninstalled for the last time.,negative
"Haven't even tried the app and not going to. Was using the website and had a box pop up giving me the option to download the app or say that I already have the app. I didn't want the app so pressed the option saying I already have it. It then proceeds to take me to the app store to download it. So I went back and pressed the other option, it again takes me to the app store. There is NO way to continue browsing on the site, they force you to get the app.",negative
"Writing on this app is a nightmare. Gotta rewrite stuff. Besides its become more of a before and after app, ppl showing off their pics here too, cuz insta ain't enough. It's almost irrelevant and stands against the spirit of the educational nature of the app. What is worse majority answers have celebrity references or just clickbait pics. The standard of content in this app has declined so much.",negative
Doesn't load properly. Consumes too much data. There seems very little or no optimization. I tried to open in Chrome but they are insisting on installing the app.,negative
"First of all I downloaded your app to post this review, after I am gonna uninstall it. because Quora has become totally money minded. in early days it was the best plateform. You are forcing people to download ur app so they can see ADS? I clicked on the mobile site on ""read more"" and it keeps asking me to download ur app. Then why the hell you are running your website if you want to divert me your application. Please refelect and do what quora was made for!",negative
"This is one of the best app to get know many things, but the interface and the functions it does, make this app really worse. :(",negative
"To be honest,This app makes me to be better version of myself..I found the users of this app are smarter and more knowledgeable than any other social media platforms..The app is the ultimate source of sharing and gaining knowledge and information that is happening around the world..it keeps you updated all the time..and I have to say the most important thing is it improves the comphrehensive level of my english a lot.. Highly recommended to all.. Thank you..keep learning..üôèüèª",positive
"This app is really irritating believe they are just fooling. 1)Usually they will censor your answer for offcourse no reason and you cannot contact them. 2) I myself have written 44 answers and my followers can ony see 19 of them also let me make it very clear I have not violated any of the policy nor my answers are collapsed. 3)They won't even care to contact you even if you give them same error,bug or privacy problem everytime. At the end it feels like it is controlled like China controls net.",negative
Lots of bugs to be cleared and with the latest update I'm facing a heating issue with the mobile phone.,negative
"Very best app to get information from required topics . There are so many user , I hope all the required answer for our question is Not fake .",positive
Earlier it was quite amazing experience but after newest updates its quality has been degraded.,negative
App Not responding well. Concept and audiance are good but i dont know why the technological team are solving the bugs despite regular reviews and comments about it. Fix it or loose user,negative
It won't let me delete my account. The website didn't work and forcefully made install the app just so I can delete it. It still won't let me delete my account. Screw this app,negative
"Firstly, sort out the crashing. I'll be answering a question in depth then boom, it crashes, I lose not only what iv wrote but the question as well. Pointless. Its not always but its when I'm in a zone of answering something interesting which is pissing me off. Also, please add a feature to stop the ""recommended by quora"" notifications. I don't want to answer them all and I don't want to have to pass all the questions, each time having to refresh, to have to get rid of the notifications. S9.",negative
"Downloaded and installed in order rate it Zero. Unfortunately minimum rating atleast one. Quora keep sending spam to my email so many times in order force us to read a topic and even if click on a topic, it will not allow you to read unless you download the pathetic app and again no reading unless you signup. Hate it wholeheartedly so much that I have unsubcribed their newsletter. But they still keep sending SPAM.",negative
"This app should have an improvement in bookmarks feature. For example, it doesn't let you know how many questions have you bookmarked nor let you sort them into categories like newest first or oldest first. Developers should really look into it. Apart from this, when asking questions it lets you to ask in only 250 characters. It should have atleast 350.",negative
"I don't know why Quora always keeps editing my questions. I want to add something more in my previously-asked questions and after some time, a notification pops up and says ""We edited your question"". Waiting for a fix.",negative
"The website works fine until you click a link. Then they make you download the app, which I downloaded so I could give it 1 star because I DON'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD YOUR STUPID APP",negative
It hangs a lot while answering a question. Have to switch off/on mobile multiple times to write a single answer. In addition to that Quora Moderation sucks! Quora needs some serious improvements. Overall the experience till date is good.,negative
"The app has become a nightmare to use. All the toggles or switches found in settings are unresponsive because of which I can't turn off the ""email quora digest"" option. The dark mode button does not respond. The pages load very, very slow. In short, it's too frustrating to use the app.",negative
Gets hang very often. Writing the answers is also difficult somtimes but otherwise a great source of learning with no parallels,neutral
"This app is completely unecessarily complicated and I am going to deactivate my account. No use in giving an app that won't work any traffic. I think it's highly retarded to coerce people into using their actual names on an app, it won't let you do anything on it until you prove that the name you gave is your actual name and they also won't let you change your name. That's ridiculous and I know that I'm not gonna spend another minute on this platform.",negative
"A life-changing App!.. Quora brought me closer to the many wonders of life, brought me directly in contact with many inspiring personalities... I owe a lot to this app.. Never seen a platform more progressive and liberal than this!",positive
If i click upon the answers from homefeed it just dosent open... facing this problem for about two months... horrible.. bring back the old quora,negative
"Cannot disable Email notifications. My mail box is filled with Quora junk and when I try to unsubscribe, it doesn't allow me to do so. The toggle button for email notifications doesn't work. This is such a cheap thing to do and disgusting.",negative
It does not load properly.. screen goes black for hours. Its really creating problems now,negative
"The app has gone from best to worst.Cant even use it in browser.The more they ask for downloading updated version, the more it has gone worst.",negative
"It is really a good app, but addictive as well. That is the only reason for 2 stars... after some point of time we will not concentrate on our work but would rather check quora... but within limits it is very good.",positive
"I don't know why but i am unable to edit my profile (change dp,add description etc) tried on both app and desktop. Would love if the quora team could fix this issue, otherwise the app is great.",negative
"Why the hell the whole content is not available on website. Why there's no cross button for not downloading the app and reading the content on web. Remember you only provide the platform, we are the once who give answers to people. Insisting people to download your app is just frustrating. Dont want to use quora anymore. Just a greedy and selfish developers app.",negative
"It was my favourite app i used to spend lots of time in this app. but now i will quit . Because it is one of among those anti-india and Anti-Hindu App. Who constantly remove my questions and disable my feature of question asking. They can't understand any indian languages and just disable any answer by a single oprresive complaint,which don't violates Quora's policy.",negative
Absolutely trash. Breaking down a perfectly working website to get people on your app will inadvertently drive away users. Quora is definitely definitely going the way of the dodo if this thinking continues. Just like most other Microsoft products trying to force their way to use them by breaking the old features.,negative
Forced to download the app by your website. It doesn't let me access the site until I download the app and see the article inside it.,negative
"I have been using this app for 4 years if am if am not lying, and i have always had a great experience using this application. You can get one of the best advise one could ever ask for. I must say, Quora is a five star app no doubt!",positive
This is a most important and helpful for every person. i am happy to use this app and i think when you install this app in own mobile you will be feel good as well.,positive
Terribly slow app. Feels like opening a decade old app. Each option takes forever to load. Crashes are so frequent.,negative
I have to say that I am devastated.I was so much exited about the app when I first know about it..But painfully I couldn't even getting access to this app!! It shows that I have no internet connection even I have 4G connection and I can get access into any of other app..I also tried to open your website..same there! Can you tell me why this is happening..really? If there were any option of giving 0 star.I might use itüò°,negative
I use it all the time very intersting reading it can be a problem when iam at work i get stuck on it lol,neutral

I would rate it 0 stars if I could",negative
"I love quora, but a lot of improvements needed for this app. This app lags. I am not getting a smooth experience. Expecting improvements from developers.",negative
"The app (and website, almost) experience is awesome, the only thing that bugs me(in the website) is that once you have visited one link on it from googling you can't go to other pages contained in that page itself if you try, you get irritating login/signup screen. I understand that it's meant for age restriction but you could have chosen the much simpler (more correct) way of allowing the un logged person to view every text part of website only without access to things like vote comments, etc.",negative
"I remember it being a place for experts to answer questions, people were accredited, layman wouldn't share their opinions if they were qualified to answer. Now on the homepage, you don't even see questions but straight up self-congratulatory inciteful posts. Moreover app is buggy and laggy as hell. And Quora is designed so that you would get addicted to it whole day. Reddit and Stackexchange are way better.",negative
I don't know whats happening with Quora but when i connected my home wifi its saying no internet message on quora but other apps are working fine even i can browse website. Fix this asap,negative
Didn't make an account on this app. And yet somehow they made an account for me and has spammed my mail for months without being able to unsubscribe. Finally had enough and managed to delete my account after the app crashed 5 times. Avoid this app at all costs!,negative
Best app I've really gained knowledge from. But I noticed that it crashes when used for long. Please fix this and please make the quora app have offline mode like to save a page and come back later cause where I stay data is quite expensive and not too strong. Thanks.,negative
"I like the concept, I like the users.. many of them helping a lot, but it goes with too many rules. Wrong uppercase/uncomplete name > banned, giving the same link 3x > banned (B), asking with the wrong grammar > B, wrong answer according to QM > B, and many more. Can't turn off the notif in my origin language, so it's SPAMMING my phone & email. Can't go back to edditing my question after click next, so it's wasting times by finish it & delete after that, and many other problems.",negative

I love quora. But the app is very much slow. Showing nothing as it needed to show. So it is needed to be fixed soon. Going to uninstall the app. The web version is better than using the app.,negative
"I don't have enough memory left in my phone to install another app. But I love quora and I want to continue using it with my browser.

"After updating the app, comments are not loading. Upvote buttons are sometimes working but sometimes not. Not reloading on pulling the current page from top to down. Are all these happening because of slowness? If I want to reload then have to save the link or bookmark it so that I can get the same answer after restarting the application.

It takes abysmally long to load eveey article. Its impossible. Sonetjmes it takes 30 seconds to respond to a click. No clearing the cache or data doesnt help. Neither does reinstalling. Its just absolute pile of trash as far as apps arr concerned. I hope to God a third party app exists,negative

"Awful. Forces you to pick 10+ categories to get info so they can spam you. They dont offer option to turn off notifications, correction, you get that page to turn it off, you think, but the toggles dont work on any of them to turn off notifications. I don't want to be forced into picking 10 categories just to use an app. Then they further want you to pick 5 more categories within those 10 categories. I only want ONE category.

Please improve the user experience as you take all the joy out of exploring the wonderful content.",negative
Really badly designed app & incredibly frustrating to use. Quora is not typical social media and questions often require in-depth answers.

"Pathetic app experience. Most of the time app is super slow, takes minutes to load an answer. Very unintuitive to use.

"A great app and platform for question and answers as well as a great way to discuss topics without the toxicity of social media platforms. To the Developers: There is a problem that creaps up in the app with long responses while using the Grammerly Keyboard. It only happens in Quora. When it attempts to correct spellings or grammar, it will replace the wrong word and the app freezes. Just prior to freezing, you can select a spot to correct but it types elsewhere.

Its great app and all. A great platform. Very informative and helpful sometimes but Quora needs to work on it regulations.

This app needs a design overhaul to Material Design. And of course the occasional lag of loading articles is annoying.,negative
"They use very aggressive approach to make people download there app. You're on there website, reading stuff. When you open another link, they force you to download the app. Worst experience so far.

"Low Vision Users Get Zero Support! Unlike on the Web-Version, the Apl Doesn't Allow Pinch and Zoom, or any Way of Making Font Bigger! Likewise, When System Font/Size is set to Large - App will Not Work Properly! (Which is WHY pinch and zoom is useful!).

"I don't know about any of the technical faults;( as many of the users are mentioning in comments) but what I know and am completely sure about is that,this space is for intellectuals and has completely changed my life, I replaced Instagram/facebook with QUORA and saw the result in less than weeks. It gives you the self-confidence you need, the knowledge you crave for. And most importantly, it kills your time by providing you knowledge, not by showing you some pictures of models as in instagram",positive
"The reason I am giving you 3 stars is your app has a lot of bugs and glitches ,which nobody likes about your app. To say Your app is the best to answer day to day questions but you too should answer the questions. I will give you 5 stars only when you improve the app and it's interface. Message me back after you have done it. Thank you I am uninstalling the app cause websites run faster than this.",negative
"I love this so much, somehow it helped me to open up and ask questions that i was afraid to ask others because i think they'll judge me, its like my best friend and when you write a question you get a response fast. I dont care about the delays and crashes this has helped me a lot, i get anxiety fast and this helps, i love it and i dont even know how this helped me.",positive
Why is this app so slow? You send a notification for every update and every time I expect that this is one which would make this app faster but no!! Never fail to disappoint to you!! You guys are really not taking this matter seriously are you??,negative
A lot of troubles in signing in...fed my mood off literally...I tried everything from Google from fb but again n again eriors..PLZZ set up these problems asap,negative
Nice app for clearing your curiosity. You will get the answers of all the required questions in best way. Sometimes insatisfactory but that's not the fault of this app. So it worth 5 stars.,positive
"Having this app for severl years, I've changed my mind of their true intent. So many times in the middle of answers, it will just shut down, or slow to quistionable speeds being extremely slow and cumbersome to use. It uses more resources then it should for this type of app. When this happens I think its mining and/or spying for information. I believe the information they gather is not to our best interest. I get warnings from Google regarding their practice. My previous 5‚òÜ rating is now a -1‚òÜ.",negative
"As per their policy of names,no matter how many times you correct your name it'll always revert back. Filing issues doesn't even work.",negative

There is a problem with this app you can't log out of someone's account. if you want to create a new password it will go to the person that is currently logged in.,negative
"This app needs a lot of improvement. I think you can get what's needed from the other reviews. Quite sadly, the mobile Web version is much better.",negative
Useless app yet you force people to download it. Very useless app. We shouldn't be forced to download something that's so slow.,negative
Why this app is so slow? It took almost 1 to 2 minutes to load something where I have a good internet. I can watch 1080p video in YouTube without any buffering but Quora cant load quickly. Please fix this..,negative

"Sign up if you want a crapton of email spam, with the added bonus of it being a pain to unsubscribe from it all.",negative
Forcing the app on mobile devices is a controlling and highly unappreciated move by a lot of users. I would not reccommend using this app to send a message to the Quora team.,negative
"app doesnt work, the more I use it the more I get annoyed by it; it randomly goes back to the home page unwantedly, takes a million years to load anything, glitches out all the time. Why couldnt we just use the website instead of quora forcing this app up our asses?",negative
Whenever I open the app this annoying update notification comes up and I have to close the app. This is frustrating. Please add a ignore or download later option.,negative

"Since I updated quora app, it turned more slow and does not let me open the questions. After updates, the app was ok, but some questions had delays, even more than app before updates. After some days, the app took more time for starting and some questions did not react to ""see more"", and, therefore, I could not read the whole question. Since some days until today, simply, the app does not work. I can't follow, save drafts, read, etc. I hope quora staff fix these issues. It's a great app.",negative
Very fun app with great interaction and information being exchanged.* Update posted on 7/29/2020. I do have to add that it is a great deal biased at times against Americans for some reason lately. A lot of the info has become politically biased but you have the option of blocking it or simply ignoring those pages and comments. For the most part it is a good source of intellectual interactions without the biases and stupidity.,positive
Why is the app so utterly slow and incable. It's frustrating af. I love quora but the app is pretty much useless.,negative
"Love it. I'm an information junkie and Quora is what the internet is all about. Answers to everything and anything if it's known in the world. I'ts an incredible time to be alive. As for the Ap. I don't know, it seems to work fine for me. ü§ô",positive

App is definitely great but it's a real pain to open this app if internet connectivity is little weak.. They should work on making it little lighter!!,negative
"After updating days ago, am hardly getting anything done on the app. It's extremely slow. I suppose a lite app is good.",negative
"Navigation from email notification to content on the Mobile App needs improvement....you're redirected to the answers you clicked on from your email a couple of times, then it becomes impossible to find those answers; app takes you elsewhere when you click the link to a particular answer from your email.

"The app has lost its charm, it has become monetized. All the Feed is filled with memes, fake stories and not researched answer. Very less people are present that give well researched answer and content. It has become a place for promoting agends and algorithm has become worst i.e. more photos, memes is equal to more upvotes and shares. Hope it will all change for better. Advice to Quora, Please do not add Insert Video option, it will destroy what good is left in the platform.",negative
It's an amazing app to enhance ur knowledge..... I love dis app...but it has some flaws also.. which i really want the app maker to take care of.. sometimes when i try to open the answer it shows nothing .. it does not show any content..,positive
The contents and comments are of high quality. But the text font is just too small. Reading the text puts so much pressure on my eye.,negative
Excellent platform and design. The quality of questions and answers decreased a lot from the early years (as expected). Not always easy to see come of your past answers/activity. Edit: since few months the app fails to open from the email weekly updates and the loading times take forever.,negative
"STOP DELETING ANSWERS FOR NO REASON. My favourite writers and many more who contribute a massive amount to the website's friction are LEAVING because thousand words long and objective answers are being deleted for ""policy violations"" and ridiculous reasons like ""offensive"" or ""unhistorical"" while they are not and NOONE thinks so. If you don't want this already unstable platform to die and keep making losses, stop with this nonsense",negative
"It's very inconvenient. I am searching for answer on online and i entered into this website, but it didn't give me a choice to access it untile i download the app. This is very very inconvenient.

There is a bug in this version! Please fix asap. There is a memory leak in the app logic that takes in comments on answers. It causes my phone to heat up and slow down.

It has become very hard to use Quora now. Lot of delay in opening the answers & sometimes not at all.,negative
It's like they're trying to make the app more annoying with each update! Now I can't even open an answer. I have to click suggest edit to see the answer! This is crazy. It's not even a real app just a web browser that seems like an app. How hard it is to show some text on a damn HTML page?!,negative

"The home page is full of nonsense that i don't want to know.. Like my home page is full of British royal, their clothes or drama. I am following some spaces and i want stories related to them.i don't know if you guys have any hidden setting for that to do.",negative
The app is full of censorship and promotes low quality content. The number of ads is becoming unbearable.,negative
"I enjoy the app, but my keyboard glitches and spams random letters only when using this app. My phone is also new with no damages, which leads me to believe that this is an in-app glitch that needs to be fixed. I have a screen recording depicting the glitch.",negative
"For a text based app, it is taking forever to load. Requesting to make it faster to load. Thanks!",negative
Great app with great features and great people. Really can help out with questions. Only thing I don't like is that it sometimes doesn't respond after a while of scrolling. Apart from that it is really good.,positive
"I encountered some problems with this app. It is slow, when I write an answer and switch tabs, it doesn't work. Sometimes it directs me to playstore while reading answers. And more. Need improvement.",negative
"The Quora app is degrading. Before it was so swiftly worked. App used to open quickly ( now even after updating, it takes zillion of years to open). Even i don't like the ""your Space"" menu they have added. Not at all happy. Now i don't hardly read anything from this app as it lost its quality and interfacing surface.",negative
"The app is great for sharing knowledge, ideas n thoughts. But there are still some bugs wrt old feed stories repeating, Screen freezing and slow interface.",neutral
"Quora forces you to install the app (this is, their code bloat) to see more than 1 question in phone. Even if you do have an account, you cannot simply use the page. Terrible practice. I will block you from my google search results fram now on.",negative
So nice app. Very informative. Got so much knowledge from this app. Only problem is App text font is very small. Kindly make it big size.,positive

"There is a couple serious problems that need to be fixed. One, sometimes things are really slow to load or don't load at all, and two I can't check my notifications because it keeps telling me something failed.",negative
"Only reason I downloaded the app because I was forced to, web version of Quora doesn't display full answers and redirects users to download the app. I don't see any advantages of the app over web version",negative
"OMG quora is awesome at first tune I was kinda liking and enjoying it but now I have my own account and lots of viewers and followers. I get many requests and I aslo answer all I can plus I just love that you can search for any topic you like.

Quora has become the most irritating social media site. The app is not very nice and i am constantly pestered to download the app while reading on the mobile site. I DON'T WANT THE APP. KINDLY STOP FORCING ME TO DOWNLOAD IT.,negative
This app is just no like as I thought. Whenever I ask any question it shows an interface like any news in google page. This is just a useless and time waisting app.,negative
Forced to use app. And the app doesn't work even on 4g speed. Pages not loading. To open a answer we need to wait atleast 5 mins. Pathetic app.,negative

Great app. Never any problems. Love the questions and answers. Really entertaining . Love the stories.,positive
"There are too many stupid people claiming that they know something. There are quite a bit of fake information going around under certain topics, but hey, that's the internet that we all love! Also, don't ever get involved in any political topics on Quora, people will eat you alive through the screen, just because you said the obvious truth that our worlds reality openly displays. Other than that, it's a great app to share knowledge and learn something!",negative
very good app to knowledge transfer.lot of unknown facts and questions help in understanding the problem or situation better.it is also a platform to motivate based on life experience stories.,positive
"Too slow response of the app. Moreover in the mobile browser, please make an article view not full page view. Too slow!",negative
"Editorial policies are worst. Without prior notice they blocked and sometimes without any proper reason they do the same. No support from support team at all. Recently they blocked without any policy violation and when I asked support from team, they just came with an excuse that it's all done by system. If all done by system then no need of support team because they all are dependent.",negative
"The content is great, but the app is hard to load. Sometimes the loading time takes too long.",negative
I do not want an app which is basically a browser that only works for one website. Let us use our regular browsers.,negative

"I enjoy this app. There are catergories which you follow and comment and read what others feel and relate to for a certsin question . By reading their responses, you can tell how people think and process info about various topics. Its an intruguing advantage when you come into similar trials, and decision making moments during your journey in life. Absolutely without a doubt the idiots are on the app and making their views a part of whats being discussed..part of it...about to run out of spa",positive
This app is very frustrating (particularly Upvote function). I can read any answer alright but when I try to upvote that's a no man's land unfortunately.,negative

Awesome app for knowledge sharing. Only thing is that you cannot use the app when there is an update available. This is annoying as sometimes I am in hurry but I have to sit and update the app to get the answer. Else everything great!!,positive

"Quora is the worst app and website. I can't view most of the answers in my browser until I download the app, even though I am logged in through my Google account. I dont want your app. When i went to delete my quora account, I had to create a new, separate password to delete it because it was linked through Google. I remember even setting up my account I had to choose interests like it was some sort of exclusive club. I look forward to finding a way to never see quora in my search results again",negative

The worst app of my life. When people just try to understand the app how you could block them. This app block me just because l use short form of my name. I will never open this app again and l just give one star to write comment only. I pray that this app will never grow more you just have to give warning or suggestions then you can block the person if necessary steps not taken. l hate this app. l never recommend this app to any one. l know this comment will be remove soon. worst app of world.,negative
Really an awesome app that explains in simple English that is very useful to those who have knowledge in that language especially college-goers. There is a suggestion for an alert information of answer of a question asked.,positive

I'm using a Galaxy S10 plus with Android 10, a bunch of memory, and very few apps installed. Creating or editing answers or comments is as bad as it can be. Words are inserted, copied, and deleted at random, and the app hangers several times a day when creating or editing a large post, as is common on Quora.",negative
Amazing app.It has amazing information. People sharing knowledge and stories on it. It has spaces for quotes and various topics which may interest different people. Also has personal messaging. In all a great app!,positive

"With a heavy heart, I announce that Quora simply does not the yesteryear magic. I started using Quora in 2017, and was amazed by the quality. Every question was opportunity to learn something new. But today, it just stands as a filtered Instagram, where memers share their memes, models share their photos to increase Insta followers, and the answers are all super cliched and boring as hell. Only 1 out 500 answers contain the yesteryear magic. Just migrate to Medium. - From a heartbroken fanboy.",negative

"I've loved Quora. I have learned some important topics here but I have also been disappointed by the increased amount of angry debating on Quora and use of moderation. The app itself is okay but it does not have the full functionality of the full website. This is a disappointment and so there will be times when you will need to log on on the computer. If you only ever use the app, you may not be aware of the full range of options to manipulate answers and settings.",negative
"Disgusting...over flooded with ads .. ADS ADS ADS ADS everywhere . We all knew this is the endgame, but man they took it to whole another level.üòÇüòÇüòÇ",negative
Reading on the app is much more inconvenient and difficult than the website. The mobile website forces one to download the app as there is no option to remove the popup which tells to download the app. There is no other reason to download the app. Why would the website force one to download the app other than the fact that there is no other reason one would prefer the app over the website. App is useful only because its Quora.,negative
"Quora was great BEFORE the recent updates. Now it's just really slow nothing loads. I only got the app in the first place because I couldn't read two sentences without a pop up blocking the screen and telling me to download the app to continue. And I did, just for the sake of being able to read the answers on there. I would have been okay with that IF the app was actually functional. It's not, not anymore. Great if it's fixed but until then I'm uninstalling and leaving this here.",negative
"Best social app I've ever watched. It offers infinity information and experience that anyone can find helpful.

"Despirately needs dark mode. When I started using quora, it is one of the best platforms for reading useful content, and embrace it years. Developers are quick to apply any change. In recent years through starting awesome changes like Ads,QPP, spaces and quora hindi are making quora more powerful. But they didn't introduce dark mode till the date. All the other platforms like Medium, pocket and other implement it. Why not QUORA? Don't know. Edit: Now, finally Quora gave dark mode to all users.",positive
This app has not been updated for ages. Its not loading atleast for more than two months. Seems like entire developers shut down the app and left their offices.,negative
"Its a great way for us old guys with lots of experience, to help where we can. Others, can anonymous ask anything It's great. Wish we had this when I was young.",positive
A very helpful solutions to queries. Really like it ! Keep up the good work.. guys. ü§ó,positive
I like the way quora is but the problem is the performance is just not so perfect. And the other thing is that you can't post a picture with your questions so I'd like to see this new option coming in a new update of quora,negative
"Makes no sense to ask a question if you can't give any context to the question. I get why they did it, to combat repetitive questions, but some questions just need context in ordered to efficiently be answered. This will just detract people from wanting to ask questions, and in worst case scenarios just promote basic questions like ""Who's Luke Skywalker's father?""",negative
"I want to use the website, not the app. Stop showing a pop up with no cancel button or I'll stop using quora entirely",negative
Their web version is very bad. They just pushed people to use their apps thats why I can not read the articles many times.,negative
The interface and style of navigation seems clunky to me... would be better if things flowed a bit better...but overall a good app for reading and sharing whats out there,negative
"In all honesty, the app sucks. It' constantly loading, crashes when you try to edit ANYTHING and in general, just a super unpleasant experience. You'll be better off using the browser version.",negative
"I used this app a lot. Was never able to write a answer: I was banned from writting it and I don't know why the F. The app is real good. Provides quality content. The idea behind it is genius. However the recommendation is BS. If you check one thing, you keep getting it. Even though you don't want it. No response whatsoever from customer service staff. I even tried to create a whole new account from scratch. Way complicated. No updated to improve the quality. No care for app whatsoever. Sad.",negative
"Brings the keypad to a grinding halt. This has happened, now, across 4 high-end Android devices. ""Be nice"" moderation is abused by users, and very seldomly vetted by Quora staff. If you merely disagree with another user, they can simply flag, to have your comment deleted.",negative
"server always slow, my internet is working fine, it only open fast when i open it using browser like chrome, the application itself is very slow",negative
"This site used to be great. Now it promotes a lot of click bait and misinformation in its ads. Rather than recommend to you scholarly content and groups in the veins of the topics you follow, they more commonly recommend trivial and amateur content and groups. Besides the fact that there are many great writers contributing (if you have the patience to find them) I am very disappointed",negative
I will never use this app again. I would rather log in through a browser. The time it takes to load a post is time wasted when I should be doing something better.,negative
why you Always ask for sign up while browsing quora. Why you are begging for sign up and showing half information and then asking for sign up it's our will if we will sign up or not you have to show full information...,negative

"I liked this. But when I read some threads on website, it pops up a window saying open in app. There we get 2 options, get app for free and get the app. I can't read it anymore on site.",negative
Quora is Great app for questioning anything which you eagerly want to know.... You can ask any questions and can follow any topics of your choice. But sometimes the upvote or submit answer click doesn't work üòî,positive
"It insists on spoonfeeding you a set number of junk topics in the beginning, rather than allowing you to choose topics you're interested in as you want them.",neutral
"Hey, here's another one of those "" Use our app instead of just using a browser so that we can shove ads down your throat constantly and steal all your data."" Here you go, best rating that I can give.",negative
"As many others, one main difficulty with the app is its tendency to slow down editing terribly after only a few insertions or copy/paste. One has to wait sometimes a whole minute before the app is ready to take in a modification at the right place.",negative
"After the update i am not able in to read any feed or content . Everything is blank, nothing loads on clicking view more. Bad update, earlier was good.",negative
"Worst site I have ever seen. And the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You need to be signed in to do anything unlike other apps that work ASAP and the people on the quora don't know that much it's all surface of surface layer. Wikipedia app is much better in all ways and you get dark mode and black mode and serpia (a gentle white). IN CONCLUSION, anything is better than this turd app",negative
This stupid app really sucks..it keeps on saying I've been blocked from everything the app has to offer..u can keep your retarded app..if i could've been able to give a zero star rating guess what....,negative
UI can be made more friendly and the messaging feature definitely needs much improvement,positive
I have been using this from last year and got a lot of knowledge... spending time with qoura has always been fun and gain...but the app misbehave ofently and sometimes i irritate alot.... developer should work to maximise its efficiency..and seamless ops,positive

"I'm happy that finally I got a dark mode BUT every time I refresh any page, it shows me the error and trying to fix it thingy. Please do something, thank you.",negative
"The way you push people to download app by hiding contents on web and then push people to update the app by hiding content on the old version, is very petty from your end. Imagine someone low on mobile data trying to read something but you force them to update the app before the person can get to a wifi. I'm definitely not far away from giving up and uninstalling.",negative
"Great app! Takes some time but eventually you find a group of writers you like and a group of readers finds you! Quorans choose their own areas of interest and expertise, but there are no limits. Questions are the heart and soul of Quora so ask whatever your heart desires to know. Answers can be anything from a monosyllabic grunt to a white paper. Use it to discuss current events, philosophy, science, art, and technology. Or join the flame wars in commentland! What are you waiting for?",positive
"If you're the type to seek out an understanding of a broad range of topics, I would suggest going to your local library instead. This app was once on a trajectory to become a modern day ""Library of Alexandria"" but, somewhere along the way, someone at the HQ was offered a way to profit off of the platform and it has since that time went straight down into the sewer. This app, as of today (8/11/2020) is a complete steaming pile of offal. Dissenting views are silenced. Garbage app, AVOID!",neutral

"Notification settings need to be streamlined. Literally dozens of notification categories that have to be individually turned on or off, and that's for EACH notification system (i.e. push vs email). The user shouldn't have to tap their phone a hundred times to go through all of the notification settings.",neutral
The application is full of bugs and works bad! It is slow and I can't see the comments under each question and reply. Quora is good but this application absolutely no,negative

It is a slow app. It takes time to open (even though 90% of quora is made of texts) and it refreshes all time. If you read an answer half and you want to read the rest after sometime. You can't. Because it refreshes. I did so many updates but still the program team didnt fix its slow speed.,negative
You should really reallyyy work on dark mode man!! I just couldn't read stuff because it was grey colored font on black background!!,negative

I don't know what has gone wrong with this app. Initially it was all fine but nowdays it keeps crashing and has become very slow. Even after updating it and reinstalling it again it still remains worthless.,negative
"even under wifi the app dosent runs properly,The interface lags,the app is slow to respond",negative
"Nice app, but it takes a lot of time to load and buffering is high even on stable internet connection.",negative
Quora should introduce feature of answering a question multiple times. Otherwise the app is very nice and user interactive.,positive
This is a good app and you get good answers when you ask questions the only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is it's not very user-friendly when it comes to editing your profile it honestly I think the apps come with a manual built into the app because honestly it is quite confusing figuring things out on your own whoever made this app needs to fix these problems and make it more user-friendly until that happens I will keep the app uninstalled for the lack of functionality,positive
One of the terrible app interface i have ever seen. Contents are good but app is ridiculously slow. It looks like it can damage a phone.,negative

"Concept is great: Intelligent QnA, but the app is sluggish, and sort of, redundant (?) in the sense that you click on the ""read more"" section from a web page or something, and it brings up the ""official"" (identical) page inside the app (sluggishly) and the ""read more"" section remains unexpanded, so again, from inside the app, you click ""continue reading"" where (FINALLY) it brings up a separate window with just the one article expanded.. With persistency, you get there, but ugh. It needs work.",negative

Very poor! Your notice which you send in middle of reading to install your app is infuriating.,negative

Quora is one of my favourite apps from social media....But the thing I wanna say about it is that it is genuinely underrated...It a social platform with lots of interesting and qualified people...I mean you get to learn so much from them.It is definitely a worthy platform to spend your free time and make people understand your thoughts about a particular criteria.The app controls should be improved...That's the reason for 4 stars....Lmao.Peace out.,positive
App as a whole 5 on 5. This app needs a major revamp. 100% Speed is slow. It hangs often. Very bad for an USA based app.,negative
So many dark patterns. It's purposefully manipulative to make sure you get as many spammy emails and I just spent 20 min refusing each individual newsletter.

"This app is just wonderful with its amazing information, valuable lessons and life hacks. But i had to uninstall it because the app just blocked my profile due to unreal username, well I don't want to use my real name, this should be an option like any other social media, so I'm sorry i had to uninstall it.",negative
Its a shame that such a big names are behind the development of this app but still poorly optimised. Shame.. i use samsung a3,negative
Not enough space in the question box for further elaboration. An additional box under the question could help.,neutral
Love it !! Only if they can move that red plus annoying icon blocking portion of the home page !,positive
"Could have been designed better, many basic features are missing. Quora 
have great content but there is no efficient way to short the good content 
as its search feature is just awful. They don't even have night mode and 
it's a reading app",negative
Doesn't load any content. Very slow. Android latest version is hanging and crashing in LETV 1S. Soon after hang phone restarts.,negative
"I've been using it for more than 3 years by now, and that's only because the knowledge I get there. The motive of quora is so good, but the way it's webiste/app functions is terrible. It takes a lot of time to load answer/comments or even notifications! Please fix it quora, It'll get a lot better and good customer traffic.",negative
"Spams notifications, has a tab that says ""X notifications, things for you"" but you can't ever clear them. Don't answer any questions, as you will be spammed for more. And will probably break their algorithm and it will only ever show you that one topic for the rest of time. Frustrating setting menu is poorly designed.",negative
I just want to browser quora in the browser. Why force me to download the app? I'm rating it 1 simply because I don't want to be coerced into using an app when the website works perfectly fine.,negative
Please improve application. While adding questions it hangs most of the Times. it takes many times to load. overall very great content with knowledge. I like Quora more than Facebook.,positive
Quora is very good platform but unfortunately Quora app always take unnecessary too much time to load any post or load more content even my network is fast. Please improve it otherwise i have to uninstall it forever.,negative
"When I am reading an answer why is there no button to see the other answers to the question? And when I am in a question there is a button to expand answers but not too collapse again. Sometime I read an answer expand it and realise I want to skip to the next answer but can't do it other than scroll through the entire answer. Answers should be in pages rather than an endless scrolling, no n related questions sections. I like the idea but the app is not well designed at all",negative
Please let us browse Quora on browser in peace. I've tried the app version and didn't like it. App takes up memory space I'd rather use for other apps. Browser version is perfect but forces us to download this Quora app. The solution?I don't use Quora app. I browse Quora on desktop web browser only. No more mobile browsing cause it shoves this app in our faces 24/7.,negative
"Garbage! After it forced me to download the last update I can no longer use the app. Because get this, my app is out of date. After an update. I like browsing the site but this app is unusable.",negative
"App is slow. If it was fast enough, then 5 stars. Instead of forcing mobile users to install the app, why don't you guys try improving the app, then automatically people will download the app because it is faster than the web version. A win- win situation !",negative
The best ever app to blogg or read or write..... I'm using it since 4 months and have noticed not any crashes or mistakes. I've got many answers regarding my questions in the appüòä,positive
"Okay first of all, This is legit trash dude. I'm on my phone and I'm on my browser TRYING TO READ SOMEONE'S RESPONSE to a question i wanted to ask. And while I was reading, it told me to download the app. Like- Stop forcing people to download the app. They download it if they want to. You can't be making your site show the ""download the app!"" Pop up every 0.8 seconds. trash.",negative
"They forced to download the app. Its rubbish!!! Individual word / sentence cannot be copied. Irritating UX. Extremely slow. I wish play store allowed me rate ""minus 5"" !",negative
I have broadband connection using the wifi network of which I can stream HD YouTube videos without any buffering but this Quora app won't load easily. The answer request take a millenium to load. And it keeps crashing.,negative
"This app is good until you realise the amount of glitches it has, How slow everything loads and how much data it takes. App-creators make this app better or your ratings will get lower and lower.",negative
Useless app. Even if I want to read anything on web site. Your app keeps sending me link to download the app. That annoys a reader. Stop selling your app. May be try selling some useful information.,negative
The app frustrates the hell out of me.. They should allow us use our browser unlimitedly. I cant believe in this age and time an app could load so slow.,negative
Quora website is very good but the app is just pathetic. App is very slow and hangs a lot. Please make a good app asap and then I will definitely give 5/5 stars.,negative
"The App is terrible. I have updated it lot of times still no improvement. I was not able to load comments and also there was a problem in loading full answers when we tapped on ""see more"" . Now after the latest update not even home page is getting load.",negative
"I downloaded the app because the website forced me to in order to do a simple thing like change my profile people. Couldn't even click on the button on the mobile website. As much as I love arguing with internet crazies, I'm not an active quora user. I promptly uninstalled the app after I was able to change my picture. It was about a 10 year old profile pic and other users were making fun of my young age and acne and I couldn't even change the damn thing.",negative
"My app crashes in the middle of an effortful answer. Always, the app is decreasing in performance when an answer is longer than 20 sentences. Very bad feeling. Still like the platform. But I hesitate to answer questions more and more, as they disappear forever without any draft saving.",negative
I would much rather have the option to use the website on mobile instead of being forced to launch a faulty app that requires an update to even use.,negative
"Even in the good network connection, it consumes lot of time to load. I prefer to read the content in browser.",negative
Yeah I liked the content and everything about the app. But while I am using this app on my moto e it is getting hanged while trying to read the full answer or scrawling downwards... I think there is some sort of bug is there.. Hope you could fix that.... Good luck team quora... Edit ‚Äì 23/08/2020 The content quality is deteriorating and it is also becoming another social media website.,negative
"Hate this app. There are many glitches. It's slow, editing doesn't work and not comfortable to use.",negative
Pretty good. I appreciate getting various perspectives and opinions on various topics (especially controversial ones) and having pretty minimal censorship. Much better than Facebook or Twitter in that regard.,positive
"Many homework type questions, or obviously fake ones - but you don't have to read them!",negative
"Awful content. When you try and unsubscribe it keeps you on the Yes answer of wanting to subscribe, and refused to move to No when unsubscribing. Don't try to force those too read what one may seriously disagree with. Fix it!!!",negative
"This app moderation policy is a joke, even if you use a few post which are only available in hindi , they will delete it.. Writing a sensible post take quite a bit of time and their moderation policy delete it , and yes this app is so slow and that why frurstating to use",negative
"Kind of a mixed bag. Some questions are just not worth answering. But you can learn a lot just by reading answers.but the You Tube disclaimer applies. Not everything on You Tube or Quora is accurate, worth listening to, or remotely save. Buyer beware.",negative
Trash. Absolute trash. I hate that I have to download this app to keep reading other questions and answers.,negative
I have not tried this app yet when ever I began start to download any app I see peoples reweies what is happening with you all. If its hood I download and its not I leave it.,negative
Fix the damn bugs quora. Take lots of time to load. Hangs so much. I have used for 1 month and now am uninstalling it. And will be waiting for new update which it will fixes the bug. And then I will install it. Peace,negative
"I love quora. It ensembles the best professionals to answer questions. After all, common man is an expert with common sense. And i love the common sense answers. Apart from this, the navigation is smooth, and the way we can browse other similar questions makes life a hell lot easy. I believe quora for questions that google doesnt throw up straight answers!",positive
Love this app! I've learned so much interesting knowledge. Some of the questions on here really open your eyes up to the world for real. Super fun way to pass the time and gain some brainsüëç,positive
Very very slow on a fast 4G network! Please fix this issue as soon as possible. @qouraindia,negative
"It's such a shame that I uninstalled this app, it used to have such high quality content and now the feed is garbage. The worst part I get the same feed everyday, same question, same answers in different order. The idea of space was terrible, shouldn't you be learning as to what a user likes. Opening Quora was a joy for me and now it's become like facebook, utter nonsense and ads.",negative
"As much as I'd like to rate the app higher I could not. It's just so bad. Quota is like a heaven for curious people but this app stinks. It stops randomly, the page vanishes and whatnot. I am not using a bad no-brand phone, I am using a Samsung M30. I am forced to use the website.",negative
I have been debarred from posting views. Tried several times but they refused to accept my profile update. Earlier I was an active participant.,negative
Best app to learn...help full for all students..my first question to this app is how to get 10 points in 10th grade i.e.2 yrs before..with 50 percent of knowledge ü§≠..they guided me and guess what ...9.7 is my GPA.. thanks a lot...now my jee...hopeing...this should also fulfill üò≠üôèüôè,positive
Very amazing and satisfying but the solution of maths aren't written with property and reason great job üëçüëçüëç,positive
I love quora. But the app performance is disappointing. It is very slow. Also navigation could be improved.,negative
The prediction algorithms needs to be worked on. Hint: Interests can be short lived too. You could ask the user itself if he wants to continue to see posts on a certain topic.,neutral
This very helpful apps for all kind of people. Every one can know anything he doesn‚Äôt know he can through this. So very good apps,positive
Please improve the app not updated very lagging and slow response.. too slow app not a very good UI..,negative
Was great until I couldn't post anymore because I do not want my real name on the application. For security alone this should be enough. But it seems as if my security isn't as important to quora as it is to me.,negative
"Exhausting, what is with the plethora of email and push notifications that bombard your phone! Silicon valley has alot to answer for!",negative
Absolutely fantastic and helpful app. U'll get answers of each and every question.üëçüëç,positive
Latest Update Sucks! It's taking so much time to load pages and shutting down abruptly.,negative
"Hello, The app was running smoothly till the 2nd last update. From then I am affected by an issue which is quite irritating. Whenever I click on the Messages, Settings, Stats etc from the Menu, I'm redirected to Google Chrome and those tabs open in Chrome. I've tried everything but there seems to be some issues with the app itself. Kindly check the issue and patch it ASAP. It's ruining the experience. 1 star is deducted cuz of your moderation partiality and policies.",negative
"I love this app, but the problem is no matter how good my internet speed it it would take forever to load and this app crashes and hangs a lot , really i wanted to give 5 stars but this apps just dissapoints me...",negative
"Not satisfied with Quora. It asks us to use the app instead of browser consistently and yet most of the time it opens to home page, not the page I clicked on the browser (redirection from browser to the app is not working mostly)",negative
"Adobe of unchecked unverified hate speech and conspiracy theories. I thought twitter and Facebook was bad, at least they remove such content ( albeit a bit late).",negative
It crashes every time. Also the algorithm sucks. Content that is useless and is completely copied gets the most hits. Original writers and content creators get no popularity whatsoever. Improve the app and it's UI. Also start working on that poor algorithm of yours.,negative
This app sucks. It's so slow that I remember the BSNL dial up internet where I used to doze off for half an hour before a website would open. Shame.,negative
Terrible app. I have always liked the website and have been using it for years. But the app is terribly optimised performance wise. If you can't make a good app then don't force your users to install the app.,negative
Pathetic and slowest app that i ever used.. There is no option to read in web it's only the reason i download the app and still keeping in my phone.,negative
"Pathetic, takes too much time to load, when writing an answer or comment on the long run, it becomes glitchy & recently a new problem arose that whenever I click on a comment, question & answer, it redirects me to Chrome, I like this app a lot, wish it were betterü§ûü§û",negative
I really liked the app earlier but the content in it has been exponentially degrading while ads are increasing.üòü,negative
"For anyone who want to install this app now or update to latest version, dont do that now! This app have been crashed and you cant do anything in this app. You should wait to the next update to install.",negative
"Ace. Ultimate procrastinating app, one doesn't feel guilty even after spending 3 hrs on it.",positive
When trying to view quora on a regular internet browser on my phone it forced me to download the app in order to look at more than one question. This is pointless and a waste of my time. Once I'm able to use my laptop again I will be deleting it anyway so this website might as well just let me use the website on my phone the same way I normally would anyway. Apps for websites should always be optional.,negative
"Was a great platform back in days. The app has suddenly slowed down and takes too much time to load, which is too frustrating.",negative
"Just 'upgraded' to the latest app release. The new version keeps telling me to download the latest app release. Nothing else will load. Quora has been in a death spiral since the Partners Program was introduced, this was the last straw for me. I shouldn't have to work this hard for mediocre, rehashed content and insipid questions from spammers.",negative
"Like everyone else, totally pissed off as one is mandatorily supposed to install the app in order to use quora. Let this be known to the team at quora that nobody likes to install an app to read articles from quora. There are 100s of websites and platforms one interacts and it would be totally ridiculous if every websites, platforms starts developing app and start moving it's users from web version to app. I am not against app, but there should be option for the web as well in phone.",negative
"Sometimes it crashes also takes up much data to open but in ends it crashes,not a good app",negative
"Worst app ! I have seen ever In reviews some people also commenting like this But then I thought No ! This app is not bad & then just I installed it after that its not working anymore ! And mobile is also not of bad company so that ruin . I just Hate it , solve your problem as soon as posible",negative
"If information, curiosity's or just a good'ole question you have been looking for an answer to- this is an Excellent App to help widen your mind.",positive
"So much bugs when writing answers, especially a long post, the app suddenly crashes, and I was experienced force close several times.... A good content, but a bad app.",negative
"While I love Quora and am an active user there, this app is one of the worst I have ever used - crashing on a constant basis and causing me to consistently lose valuable work. Until they improve this thing, I suggest that writers stick to the website.",negative
The notification is very irritating and ads too. But otherwise a good place to read about your interests.,negative
"Best platform to exchange knowledge. i can give Quora Platform 5 Star Rating. But in regards to Quora App, i barely seen worse app like this. I mean what the heck problem with this app. It loads too much, and when it comes to write h ans or question it asks too much questions. I wrote several answers and that experience was hell. App become more worse when it comes to write in Hindi. And finally my interest goes off. I uninstalled Quora App. Guys make your app user friendly. Thanks if u read",negative
"Idea of the app is good, but it crashes and freezes a lot, and often the text jumps all over the place and randomly inserts words. People don't typically get easily offended here over stupid things. The moderation is awful, and nonexistent, oftentimes your answers will be deleted for no reason and it won't even say why? There are answers that stay up that are essentially explicit sexual stories that have many curse words, but if I say the word ""Microsoft"" my answer gets deleted. Seems Fair...",negative
Why'd you not let us use the app without updating? It's so frustrating. Not everyone can download updates within seconds and continue.,negative
"I cannot stand your app, because I like it so much (the concept) that it just kills me that the app is so poorly executed, all the freezing up and crashing I mean it is more or less constant. Every time I type more than a few hundred words it freezes up to where I can't even just edit what I have so far and post it. It is so aggravating to lose everything you just typed, and when that is combined with your horribly unfair moderation and censorship, how many suicides have you caused with this?",negative
"I love quora, but recently, a pop up started showing up every time I clicked on something, asking if I knew French. I said I didn't, and now the pop-up still shows up, but blank.",negative
"Sometimes, the writing gets messed up, the word positions break, and the whole message breaks. DO NOT USE THE APP. USE THE SITE PAGE. THE APP IS WORSE AND SLOWER.",negative
"Basically garbage. I type a few words and it freezes. I have to close the app, reopen it and hope anything I wrote is still there. To bad. I enjoyed writing answers to specifiv questions.",negative
App is pure trash. Won't even load anything. Don't download it. Stick to the website. But the site in and of itself has a lot of issues too.,negative
I don't know what the hell has happened to quora ..it is just getting worse with every update..now i am not able to read any answers...whenever i click on an answer tge screen goes white and it just shows me the name of the writer that's all.üò¢,negative
The app has become completely unresponsive and slow. Nothing loads before 30 seconds.,negative
"This app is not for knowledge, I can't find anything related to knowledge. Every thing is full of political, memes and useless questions like ""what are some screenshots which deserve 1000 million upvotes"". And this app is so slow and have lot of bugs.",negative
Good knowledge forum but is very slow to operate and repond .it makes boring experience.,negative
This is such an amazing app for reading and getting knowledgeable things about life...as well as we can improve our English vocabulary...u can ask any questions to quora it will provide uh a lott of Answers...it is a good adviser as well we can see the Mames and some funny screenshots..and many more educational things...,positive
It doesnt open. Im stuck at a blank screen with an infinitely turning circle,negative
Cannot upload profile pic at all. I've tried repeatedly and still no picture.,negative
"First one star review, here we go. Almost none of the stories/conversations had anything to do with the interests I actually took time time select. Selection process felt like one of those adds you get in an email, the one you only fill out once. (Advertising). Hard pass.",negative
"Rated it 2 stars, because app has become VERY SLOW with time and the owner doesn't allow to read answer in phone browser.",negative
Terrible. To read answers you must have the app but the app crashes frequently. I prefer using the browser. I think it's time to delete my account.,negative
"Overall it is a very good app.But when I logged in,I noticed that there are lots of bugs that has to be fixed!My phone is hanging a lot! Please fix all the bugs.",negative
"Very informative discussion on just about anything. One thing, though. As a Christian, Born Again Protestant, Ive discovered that the questions about the Christian Faith ( and answers) are heavily tipped on the Catholic side. No problem, except that the two that mostly answer ( James Hough and Father Marsden ), are very negative about Protestantism. If that were any other group, eg. LGBTQ, Blacks, Muslims,etc., it would be considered Discrimination. Very openly critical toward us",positive
"Well, it's a good informative app, but when writing an answer to the question, the Gboard crashes and it says "" quora isn't responding "" and it stops sudeenly and omg, I should try number of times to post a single answer. So, plz look into this issue",negative
"Worst app ever, doesn't work only and keeps on crashing. Done with every troubleshoot possible but still the same. Uninstalling only to never install it again",negative
it is nice i guess. i enjoy reading answers to the questions & all but it just won't let me answer or question anything. i searched for the problem online & it said that maybe u haven't correctly formatted/punctuated your question or u gave a wrong answer to a question which was downvoted but that's not it. I HAVE NEVER ANSWERED OR ASKED A QUESTION BECAUSE IT WON'T LET ME. it says it has blocked me from answering AND asking questions. i have tried to solve this problem but nothing is helping.,negative
This app is horrible.. slow loading.. web version doesn't load images properly.,negative
"Crashes constantly while editing, editing posted answers no longer works, explicitly disallows screen rotation and doesn't allow split-screen. Aside from the notifications, it's a useless app. Just add notifications to your website and ditch this garbage if you aren't going to fix it.",negative
Such a worst app. Whenever I click on the post in my feed. It only shows the author name and profile pic in the centre. The upper and lower portion of the screen remains blank.,negative
The images take a LOT of time to load!!! Also you should add different sections/features like top answers of the day/week etc.,negative
One of best app. People connect to each other and solve questions by giving appropriate answers.,positive
"It's honestly impossible to write an answer without having the urge to throw the phone through the window... because of the app. It's not bad, it's perfect, but it needs a fix (which didn't appear till some recent versions).",negative
"App very very slow slow slow ..dark mode very slow compared to white mode.. I know no one will reply here ,but just conveyed for others users and reduce the rating for not quality product.",negative
I just hate the fact that how much this app is shoved in my face. They constantly keep asking me to download this app. No one is that addicted to quora that they need to download the app. Even after you download they constantly keep asking to update the app. I just need to look at a question for merely 3 seconds but now I have to update the app for 2 minutes and then look at the answer. I hate this kind of thing,negative
It is an intelligent method of spreading information and helping others solve personal problems.,positive
"I dedect 1 star because sometimes it just stops or hang up bw I m wrighting some post, answer. You will say no your phone hang, but sry my phn is doing it's work perfectly, just the typing in your app hang up. Overall this app is amazing for gaining and sharing of knowledge.",positive
"This app takes a lot of time to load content like notifications, comments etc effing pain in the a**. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",negative
"Seems to be good in beggining. Now I can see many fake accounts with irrelevant posts. Reading üìñ is a good idea to ask questions and answers. But here irrelevant posts with pictures and other stuff that you see. Thanks,",negative
"No more the site which was 4-5 yrs back when one usually come across answers from world leaders/qualified people. Also, every answer had depth to it. Now it's spammed with trash.",negative
I have 10mb/sec wifi connection...still I dont know why this app always takes too much time in loading...when i search for a question it takes 6-15 sec of loading...need a lot of optimisation,negative
"Highly, grossly biased app for whatever reason. Highly left leaning and insensitive towards others. Also, doesn't let you post comments to answers or other comments, stating that ""you don't have permission to comment"". So I have to read garbage but cannot point it out. Uninstalled for the same reason.",negative
Opening the app via browsers never works. Always something goes wrong and refreshing doesn't help it.,negative
"I already did the latest update, yet the application shows a message that I'm using and old version of Quora that's no longer supported!",negative
Your report option is not working there is lots and lots of fake news and fake information which shouldn't be on quora but i just can't report them it always says something went wrong and we are looking to fix it. Sad to know that quora is now promoting fake news and information.,negative
"Getting worse, slower with each update. It literally takes 10 to 15 seconds to open the option i have tapped. Since i dont have all day i somehow have to return back to something else in my day when i dont have my requested option opened in the limited time i have. Cant use it with fluence, i have to wait for minutes to actually do something on it.",negative
Content not loading properly. Takes lot of time to display images even on good internet,negative
"This is the best social media app yet. A complete day for me also means that I've used this app. I have learnt tons of new stuff from this site, I cannot even begin to enumerate them. I recommend it strongly to anyone who's got a nack for learning and seeing the world from a perspective different from theirs.",positive
Good mobile app but it definitely needs some work. I've had to reinstall it twice because a glitch made it crash when it opened.,negative
Why are you insisting to download the app instead of just using the website?! Atleast users can have the rights to download it or just ignore the request. Many of us just want to read about a single topic. That's why we opt for website instead of downloading the app. Forcing people to download the app which some users use rarely doesn't look like a good user friendly policy. Blocking the page and force users to download the app just irritates to not use Quora at all.,negative
"Browser asks to download app. App asks to update it. Clicking on update says ""sharing app unavailable"". I update from play store. App still says download update. Forced to download. :(",negative
Added dark mode. Except that it tells u it version is old even after downloading the latest version.,neutral
1) This is not working 2) always redirected to the app when using quora with the browser (that's definitely unnecessary),negative
This is very irritating that I can't access Quora directly through my mail. It always asks to download the app to scroll through it. This is very disgusting.,negative
Love this platform However the app is slower than a tortoise. You are going to lose some of your cells while using it.,negative
First we are forced to use the app instead of the website and now.. this app has become really laggy since last few updates. I can't even comment without the app freezing for 5 minutes and there's nothing wrong with my phone.,negative
Network not connecting I face this issue that after 2 days the app consistently says that there is no connection inspite of a good wifi. I have installed the app two times after uninstalling and the same issue persists. Quora also doesn't function in the Google Chrome from mobile and insists to install this app which severely malfunctions. Not worth it,negative
"The site and idea is great and recommend it to anyone willing to learn and share knowledge. However, lately every time I try to write something and break a line, the app simply forces my keyboard to close and I have to re-open it, taking a lot of time to read.",positive
My experience in this app was very bad so I stopped using it instead I used web version. I came here to give it 1 star because it force me to download the app and I don't want to. There is no close options on its pop up add. It was the very same reason I stopped using quora for almost one year. You are reading a answer and add pop up without closing options. Even after downloading the app it do'nt let you use web version and force to go on app. So I am here giving it 1 star for annoying me .,negative
Very useful app. It a nice platform to talk about interesting topics of choice. Ask and answer anything you have knowledge or experience on. This is the place i can channel all my energy in learning and sharing knowledge without limit.,positive
"Won't work. I try to read articles on my phone from the emails I receive. Seems easy right? But I get halfway through a reading and get required to get and go on the app. Now I've lost the article I was reading and can never find it again, especially if I had followed a link within the page before it required me to use the app. I started using the desktop version to be able to read without the app... but now that didn't work. AND THE APP WON'T LOAD. So much for reading Quora anymore. Good bye",negative
The searching of this application I think is worst ever I've ever experienced. Even if I'm searching something it's showing whatever it wants regardless of the keywords I've written.,negative
The app work too slow while using . Please make it some more smooth . Please don't give a chache removal or install or uninstall suggestion . It won't work .,negative
"Bad user experience! This application crashes everything I write lengthy answers thanks to drafts. .... Do fix it please the application freezes and then closes by itself..... Regards,",negative
This app sucks and every thing loading time is higher. Can't even delete my account on one click.,negative
1 star for terrible experience as it always prompts to login while using the web version. It should instead be an option for users that needs to share posts / writeups. Ain't a fan of app version. Rest all good!,negative
"Saved my life more than once, in more than one way. Beautiful, connective instrument for all walks of life. Everyone is an expert at something. Quora gives the opportunity for that expertise to shine, helping others who wouldn't know or ask otherwise. Love you Quora!",positive
quora website runs faster than its app . App runs very slowly takes too much time to open a content so please work on it to fix this issue.. Thanks,negative
App is worst when i click on read more option nothing comes just empty screen is showed with the artile editor name at the centre.,negative
"This app is kinda mediocre. Although personally it gives a much easier access to Quora than a computer, it has more problems. One of them is that sometimes the feed will automatically reload when I'm reading someone's answer and ended up losing the answer I was reading. The other is that when I'm typing with my physical keyboard, the vertical line that signifies where the letters will be inputed will disappear whenever I type 3-5 words, so I have to reselect it a lot just to write one answer.",negative
"Quora has a dubious safety policy, along with their real name policy, that prevents anyone who wants to used abbreviated versions of their real name to prevent positive id by a past abuser. A response from their company when asked is that one can prevent their name from being picked up by search engines and not be searchable on the website. That's all fine and good, but that's operating heavily on the assumption that anyone with less-than-positive intentions does not have an IT degree.",negative
It s a nice app with lots of questions that I ve asked myself. If it didn t have a dark mode I would have given 4 stars but because it has e one I rate it 5/5,positive
Takes to slow after I tapped each question to answer. Future my keyboard disappeared for 1-2 minutes after opening the question.,negative
"STOP SENDING ME MAILS I have unsubscribed this feature like million times, still they send stupid and unnecessary mails. Also, when i try to disable this feature it says ""Sorry can't process your update, try again later"" SO IRRITATING and ANNOYING Also, they also remove my message for literally no reason, Idk why, it happens most of the times And one of the point in their ""policy"" was that ""You should answer in proper English, without any grammatical errors or spelling errors"" Isn't it unfair?",negative
app is getting slower with each update with no visible improvements. loading of comments is unusually slow.,negative
"Quora is a beautiful platform to ask questions, write answers and to express ourselves, no doubt about that. The problem is that the app crashes multiple times when I am writing an answer, which is highly irritating. Whenever I use the app, my phone gets dangerously hot. I don't know if there's a problem with the app or with my phone. Please solve these two issues, other than that, it's actually a really great app.",positive
This app is f***ed up! It keeps glitching and it always shuts down for no reason :) pls try to fix it cuz I can't stress it enough!,negative
Freezes multiple times within a few minutes. Slow. Fix this and it'll be a great app. (I'm using a Galaxy S10.),positive
"My biggest complaint with Quora is their insistence of me using this app on my Android device. The app is buggy and freezes snd crashes often. I have dozens of ""in progress"" answers I can't complete. Quora doesn't seem to care.",negative
"I literally had to download the app so I could leave a review. 1 star for basically forcing people to download your app. I press ""Read more"" it says ""There's more with free app"", I tap on article - it automatically opens up a Play Market. That's too much. You cant force people to download stuff.",negative
"99% of the time, links from chrome dont open. And answers take forever to load via app. God knows why it's so slow. Searching via chrome is better. Atleast stop suggesting us to install app when browsing through mobile browsers?",negative
"After the last update, the app is taking long to open. Initially I thought it might be internet issue but later realised rest everything is working normal. Too slow after the update!!",negative
"Have you ever tested this app on slower internet connections, like the ones having just say 1 or 2 mbps? The app totally struggles to deliver content on the screen, even though mostly it is just text, which is extremely light even on a 1 mbps connection. Posting an answer takes forever, and during that time user just sees an empty white screen, no user feedback which shows a spinning wheel or something.",negative
"I Love quora....my personnality improve since have being on quora especially reading about real people and honest lifee exprience and how they scale through it really help me in real life situation,the app is great and i will continue to rate it best .",positive
The application crashes and freezes multiple times while typing and answer. I wasted almost 2 hours of my time writing an interesting QA. The application got frozen and when it came back A LOT of text disappeared. I'm very disappointed and I wish I could restore my missing text,negative
"It's slow it takes 10 - 15 second to open, it always show network errors and main problem is their stupid policy which always block your answer for no reason.",negative
It is getting slower day by day.Takes lot of time to fully open any question.Thinking of uninstalling.,negative
"Honest review I have gotten my fair share of useful information from quora and am mighty thankful for that! Its like a quick google search but with a bit more accuracy and pertinence to the subject. However, the undesirable part, for me at least, is the lack of respect and insolent attitude of certain ""intellectuals"" on the platform. An intellectuals job is not to demean or disparage the simpletons rather uplift them and make them realise the power of knowledge and thinking. N.",positive
Doesn't deserve even 1‚≠ê...Extremely slow....What to rate when we can't even use it?? Takes ages to load every single pageü§¨,negative
Just a pathetic version. After updation it takes several minutes for loading. You have to wait even after having full speed internet connection. Just a time consuming poor app. Older version was much better.,negative
Apps like this are the best for the youth and for those who likes to grasp Knowledge this application is far much better than other time wasting application which had made The youth dumb but this makes you sharp and knowledgeble person.,positive
Terrible. Blocked me for no apparent reason. I reported that there's been a mistake but no change has been made since a year. Stupid Quora. Update: Nothing happened. More than a year since reporting. No action. QUORA IS STILL STUPID.,negative
"This is worst. It doesn't excess internet properly. It takes about 20-30 secs to load even the front page and sometimes shows No internet connection. I have Airtel 4G on redmi note 8 pro with MIUI 12. Also, other answers other than most liked ones are not shown in front which stops us to gain others opinions. Solve these two problems and I will give u 5 star and recommend it to friends.",negative
"This app is terribly slow.oh gosh!it takes forever to load.Moreover,oftenly it shows me there's a problem or reload page.I have 4G connection and it is fast asf.so please don't blame my Internet connection.Also when i tries to answer some of the question's answer this app got stuck in a frame.i had to restart my app again and again in order to answer a question. I seriously love this app but i really can't stand against it's poor server or whatever you call it.I had a terrible experience.",negative
You mess up with everything thing that is stable with an update. Again you have done it. The name of the author is overlapping with various things like battery indicator etc on the top of the mobile screen. And you never mention what is going to be updated in any update. You actually break things that are actually stable. That is what you do.,negative
All features in one place. Excellent app. Would lile to do more from this. Looking forward for further updates.,positive
No doubt that the app is amazing with huge and worthy content. But the app is too slow so it consumes lot of time to load,positive
It is tooo good app but if u guys provide dark mode it will be more useful to everyone and easy to read night times like me...,positive
"Requires sign-in to even view answers. And after they get your email through the registration process, they constantly spam!! Tried unsubscribing multiple times but still no luck. The answers are often mostly other people's opinions. Not something concrete.",negative
App freezes a lot and is very addictive. All answers don't show up every time.,negative
"Web version is much much better than app. Also the app is slowpok√™, and shows irrelevant topics than my search.",negative
This particular application can be very very confusing it takes some time to figure out it has an enormous amount of information but you have to be dedicated and open-minded to navigate it.,negative
"This new app is giving lot of trouble. It would be stuck, held up, double post the comments. Quora moderation team is enough. I don't need some more technical headache. Earlier version I feel less problematic and more User friendly. This new version always freezes. Added flavor is comments show the number. Like 15 for example. But it shows only one or two. Still I face the problem.",negative
"This recent version is quite slow to load stuff also it lags a lot. It has gotten a lot worse than before, don't even feel like opening it. Fix this thing.",negative
"It's popularity is increasing day by day but the developers have to update certain features like it's slow performance, takes time to open new page, slow uploading, not getting the taste of users and more. Please be serious about this.",negative
"It's a great experience with quora, as most of my questions are listed with comics I find lot of revealing facts and answers in the app.",positive
"Images are taking lots of time to get loaded, it has started to act like a very heavy app, it takes a lots of time and particularly high speed internet all the time to load the answers, which is very frustrating.",negative
"Now this app has literally got to a point where it's just waste of time to surf on it, no answers that impart knowledge like the content in the past used to be amazing but can't completely blame quora for it, it depends upon on the kind of people on the app, now a useless app like facebook and Instagram.",negative
"The Quora app used to work perfectly fine, but since I updated it just recently, I can't comment nor see comments by others. It's made the app for less interesting.",negative
A good app but could be better. An option to enable dark mode would be a welcome change.,positive
"The aap has transitioned from worst to pathetic , the navigation is so slow .Others AAP's on my phone are so fast but when I click on any link on this aap it takes ages to move to next page .",negative
"After the new update , pictures and other person posts are limited and some many times pics don't load in my phone although I have good internet connection. Hope this issue resolve soon ..",negative
Its a good app. But it lags since last update. Please fix this. PS: I don't think it is because of the Android 10 update.,negative
"Both app and website are getting too slow, despite of fast internet connection. If we scroll little bit it takes a lot of time to render the question-answers.",negative
"The app was good initially and you could spend hours scrolling down, but lately it has degraded a lot. Content is not at all same, and the feed is filled with useless qna's... The app has slowed down a lot even though I have a download speed of 40mbps...",negative
Simply Amazing! There's always something new and interesting to learn everyday.I love it.,positive
Quora is a great platform where people posts and share their views. I can spend hours reading feeds on quora. However the performance issue still persist. I just installed the updates but the app takes time to load the content. Please see if this issue can be fixed. I want to give it 5 stars again.,positive
It's really a great app for discussion and finding your answers of confusion and lot more. Thanks.üíô,positive
The app is painfully slow. Takes time to load despite a good internet connection. Navigation is a harrowing process.,negative
Forcing us to download an app only because you want to track us is bad. There is not dark mode yet which is a big minus.,negative
Very bad and stubborn application. Whenever you try to select do not send emails the option does not work.It is a pain in the neck.,negative

"Completely awesome platform to see the world from a different perspective, and to learn from experts all around the world. But the app needs to be remaked at all senses!",positive
Way too slow to use all the time. Otherwise it's good for a constant flow of content and different perspectives.,neutral
"I love using this app to search questions. Only problem I've encountered so far is, I tried adding a question. Apparently you can't add a description underneath your question. That really sucks. I don't really want to create a link. I just want describe it on Quora.",negative
"I can't change language.In this app,it gives Tamil as the default language.when I select english it does not changing.",negative
"Quora is focusing on quantity instead of quality. Most of the answers are mediocre. Before, I used to see a lot of good answers. Now, I'm seeing a lot of promoted content and lot of average answers. Better to just use reddit or if you can afford it, then pay for medium.",negative
"App is irritating and it's very laggy and slow. Despite of 100mbps internet connection, pages load after ages and obviously it's not recommended",negative
"Really a great social media relationship platform for everyone. I love this app so Much, it is my favourite social media platforms and I find it a very useful for whenever I have a question. But application is slow..improve it please..",positive
From fews days it is hanging in use. It takes lot of time to resume writing.,neutral

This app is extremely slow and really bad experience on mobile to use quora. Developers need to fix this as soon as possible.,negative
The quality of the app and the content has degraded over time. The number of ads per post also has increased. Highly demotivated to use in recent days.,negative
Never seen such an unorganized app. Its just a bunch of silly questions and spam mashed together...,negative
"A very good learning app, but need to be enhanced and upgraded to maximize its loading in our phones.",positive
Feels like web version. And I don't even want to talk about the falling graph of the quality of the content. The quora partnership program has ruined the original purpose of quora.,negative
Very useful app for students with queries . We get answers from toppers and teachers . Not only regarding science but also about many more topics . People can express their views and people can see others views and we can also follow our favourite authors and groups üëå,positive
Fake app . Mostly contact nunbers are fake . Yesterday I searched for some firms through this and numbers noted down by me ...was all fake .,negative

"I just downloaded this app for people help. I give the answer of many people and for further clarification I just put my YouTube video link about the topic for further clarification, but after some they block my account, fix it",negative
Quora is best app for me. But can be better if there is a option to save answer because only reading one time an answer you can't understand sometimes you have to read ut for two to four time in a week.,positive
App hangs a lot.. even if you have read the notification it shows everytime you login. Cannot type. keyboard gets stuck while answering. takes infinity to load.,negative
"Takes to much time...not allowed to post just a few sentences. Has to be a couple of paragraphs. Only for VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATIONALISTS. NO ""FUN"" ALLOWED!!!!

"Had to eliminate this THING! It fills the screen on my Samsung Tab A extending fully down, and eliminates the on-screen Home button and the Back one as well. Also the other, whatever it is called. The only way to turn the app off or regain any control over the tablet is by rebooting. Stupid deal!",negative
"I feel like the app is great but has a lot to improve. Here are my input. The app itself is laggy, buffer time is bad, and I feel like it contributes to the fact that the app size is only 8mb meaning that there is some problems due to the uncompressing of data in the app. It is in no way smooth and can also affect your phone. Maybe tone down and adjust the app so it runs smooth enough. I am in no way knowledgable that's why I used Quora for and I was quite disappointed when I used the app.",negative
"Whenever i search something in google and a quora webpage appear, it doesn't load in this app. Please resolve this issue",negative
Most idiotic concept carrying app. Carrying a tons of issues ! Without updating one cannot use the app ? Why so ? Downloading the app gives you the right to access it in any condition. Having a software update available for phone doesn't mean you won't be able to use your phone unless you update it.,negative
"I like using Quora but trying to use it on a smartphone and they force you to download the app. I would rather use the website version instead of an app, but I have no say in the matter. The app download link keeps popping back up every time I close it out",negative
"WARNING!! You need to keep a track of time. There is so much informative subjects to read, and definitely an educational app.",positive
App is not opening after update(09/09/2020). The app is good but what is the meaning if can not access it. Test your update before push it to the playstore.,negative
There is a major problem with this app and the developers show no interest in correcting it. It's a pity since this app has the potential to be something really useful . The search(for topics or questions) is terrible. The exact question one asks is never displayed. Many words from the question are skipped. This results in the display of answers of some other question. Needs to be fixed asap.,negative

The app has become very very very slow.It takes ages to open any answer . Please fix it.,negative
"Telling the difference between read and unread notifications is difficult, the background is a very slightly different colour, so I have to squint to see it. Not very user friendly. The keyboard closes every time I start a new line by pressing the enter key. Answers are frequently collapsed for arbitrary and obscure reasons, then reinstated on appeal for equally opaque reasons. Policy documents are hard to find, poorly worded and easily misunderstood.",negative
From 2 to 3 days my quora app is not working smoothly and buffering is to slow. But my other apps are working properly and there is no network issues. Help me out plse.,negative
It's very slow.. I uninstalled it today but I'll revisit it in one month because it is better than insta and fb.. hope it will be resolved,neutral

"I can tell the freaking thing needs YET ANOTHER UPDATE when it starts running slow and derpy. I load it and...see no difference. When the app runs well, it does its job. However, lately it has sat there endlessly loading a page until I just give up and restart the app. Today, though, it has decided to crash every time. 9/9/2020 : Still freezing up, running slow & crashing. I decided to install it again, stupidly thinking it would be improved over an 8 month period. Nope. STILL TRASH.",negative

"Put in pages instead of an infinite scroll feed. The infinite scroll keeps on hogging memory and app becomes slow, at the end it hangs because device runs out of memory. Freshly updated app says this version is out dated, like what? No dark mode for a reading app? this has to be easy right? The updates are all just design changes, add some real functionality please.

"Very iritating. When you finish reading an article in your feed, it usually jumps back to the top of the feed when you go back. It doesn't always happen - maybe 85% of the time. You lose your place, then you have to scroll find where you were. I'd also like to see support for a physical keyboard; maybe enable the page up/page down buttons and other shortcut keys to improve navigation",neutral
Quora content is great if you follow good content but this app is a garbage. It slows down with every update.,negative

"Awful, crashes constantly. If it does work it might not load content at all, just a black empty screen.",negative
"This used to work just fine before, except the problem that it was actually kinda slow, especially the maths loaded slower in the app than in the browser. With dark mode on it gets even slower. Over the last few weeks, the ""Add Question"" button isn't working properly. I tap it over and over but nothing happens",negative

I did not like this app because there is a lot of negativity in this app. People who wrote reviews in this app they all have high expectations and when they did nit reach to that expectation they are writing like this.

"Overall, I love using Quora since it's good for when you're bored or just need something to do. But what I don't like, is how this app for me constantly has issues of lag when trying to write responses, open answers, etc., and bailing on me when I use it for an extended amount of time (as in crashing). If the lag issue can be fixed or at least improved, I will give a 5 star review.",positive
I like the Hindi version because so much good news which I did not know due to reading English language mostly. Besides real knowledge about India is in Hindi Quora and not in English.

"First of all this is a great platform in terms of different subjects, people, places etc. Only thing worrying is the whenever i open a answer to read the page will be blank. Sometimes i have to refresh multiple times or kill the app and reopen. If you could solve this with updates it will be great.",positive
The app sucks. Always gets stuck for 1-2 minutes between pages. Horrible app for such an Honorable community.,negative
I don't know it's just so much fun When you actually don't know what to do you just ask a Question and then they answer It's really helpful besides that it's so interesting getting to know what people think about diffrent topics Yeah i feel like it's a normal app I use it every day Thank u,positive
"1. App is slow 2. If i open a link from Chrome, instead of that question, quora home page opens. 3. I'm unable to unsubscribe emails from quora digest",negative
"This app hangs too much, Quora is such a great platform, but app needs some development, smoothness is required, (on18 June 2020). I didnt find the option for anather review so I'm editing this review in this day( 15 sep), this app has become even more worse after an update. I don't understand why they can't fix this issue, this app hangs too much, Quora is one of the widest used sites worldwide, I request the developers to fix this ASAP with the new update, this app needs a smooth interface.",negative
Please stop giving so many notifictions and junking our notification bar. This is really annoying.,negative
"Downloaded this app one and got spammed with constant notifications. Uninstalled but still got spammed with qoura content via my Gmail account. Kept clicking unsubscribe on emails but it only unsubscribe s one of dozens of topics. No way to disassociate my email address, or close my account or easily stop all content. Trying quora out turned out to be a horrible mistake for me.",negative
"This not a good app anymore... Back in 2011-16 this app was good but now it is full of porn, sex stories stuff I hope u will see the review and improve it",negative
Reinstalled the app after quite a while away from it. It's even worse now. Text entry is so glitchy it makes it almost unusable. Content of the app is quite trashy too. Feels like reading a website that tried too hard to monetise its content with invasive adverts and clickbait articles.,negative
"It's not the application but the people (some who think they're professional and some just mean. One person didn't like my advice, and she told me ""she hoped I'd never be her nurse's. And vice versa, they should be so lucky! (lol). It has a great premise to help people.",negative
"This app has the potential to be one of the best, but because of the lack of the ability to use ones right to free speech. I am part of Quaras partner program and have banned for 2 week stints at lesast 5 seperate times. I never know why Im banned, and Im careful not to be disrespectful when asking questions, answering questions, or replying to an answer or comment. I appeal, but never receive a response. The site is very liberal site as far as bias. My biggest comaint is no helpful feedback.",negative
"Love Quora, hate the app. Why do I have to go right into an answer instead of just extending it below and keep scrolling like i can on the website. Very annoying as i like to just keep scrolling without having to press back after each question.",negative
"When I scroll down on any page... at the end where no more scrolling is possible, page starts blurring... please fix this issue...",negative
"Great platform bad app, 2 more stars for you if you can fix stability issues.. Edit 1. Dropped 2 stars. The app these days, takes ages to open a question/scroll and see other answers/or to type and submit an answer. Thats unsatisfactory. Hope the team doesn't let the platform down. Edit 2. App gets more lethargic with each new update.",negative
The recent update made the top contents of the app to merge with the notch of my phone. It is creating a lot of problem. Please solve this bug,negative
Why do you deteriorate it every time with new update..it is horribly slow and takes ages to load the page..its really frustrating..please do not mess such a wonderful app,negative
I love Quora but the recent updates made it very slow. It made the whole phone slow and unresponsive. Maybe more optimization for low end smartphone would be great especially phones that have 2GB ram or less. I don't know why such a simple app (No pun intended) would cause the phone to be so slow.,negative
Useless. It takes a very long time to open even a very small file. I'm sorry I ever installed and upgraded it.,negative
"I can't log into my account nor i can change my password, always getting this message that we can't send password recovery mail to this id and if I'm trying to create an account from same email id it is stating that this mail id is already in use. Really disappointed.",negative
"Quora is really good for keeping day to day updates. However, since today I am facing an issue; when I click on read more, feed gets open but name of writer or whoever posted it coincides with my phone's status bar. Please fix this issue.",negative
Its useless app..it was better to use when it was working on Chrome or other browser. We are looking ahead.,negative
"This site is bull, they remove answers for no reason, block you for having an opinion but if people send death or rape threats it's ignored. This site is biased and a waste of time. It's meant to be a place of free speech and discussion. I've tried to deactivate my account but they won't let me. Don't waste your time unless you stick to their rules which are vague and useless. Absolute waste of time and needs shutting down",negative
"Awful I'm not a robot verification that takes up to TWO minutes and doesn't last long long enough so after resetting your password you have to spend TWO MORE minutes to answer all of the checkboxes. Literally 12 tests each time. Why every other app on the market has one, maybe two checkboxes. Unnecessary and bloated security design.",negative
The most helpful social media in this platform. So much stories and knowledge thay we need. Fun and entertaining.,positive
I wanted to setting up the lenguaje in english and it wasn't able to do it. Team Quora you need to fix the app and let the people select their idioms. I live in Mexico and I wanted to read the app in english. Let me Know if you were able to fix it...,negative
"The concept of the app is very good. But this app needs many improvements like user interface, speed,etc.",positive
"This app is becoming problematic in its UI. I had deleted four of my shares months ago but recently they have started appearing as THIS ITEM WAS DELETED. Plus, my shares no. has increased from 12 to 16 because of this. Further, my pinned answer is not being shown at the top. I mean what's happening? I even tried contacting quora team but they did not reply to any of my emails.",negative
Great app. After the last update it seems visually broken on phones with bigger screens.,positive
Awful app. The content is great but I couldn't view it in this app. The only time I have ever seen the content is when I open it up through Chrome without the app. That's why the ratings are so bad the app stinks the content is great but I could not access it through this app try Chrome instead. But of course Chrome on Android is not going to give you the full experience so there you go 1 star,negative
The app and the technical system of quora is terrible. Pinned answers don't show in the top of profile.... The app is damn slow. The app doesn't have all editing tools. So baddass,negative
"A question/answer forum reminiscent of an encyclopedia, wikipedia and google, along with some intellects and ""know it alls"" all wrapped up in one app. Very interesting and sometimes funny. However, it's just another social media platform, only it's a Q&A website.",positive
I do love writing here.. it gives immense satisfaction to be able to help someone with our experiences..,positive
"Very pushy website that doesn't even show the content after a while, unless you install the app!",negative
So much of phishing links are there please delete that in your contents orherwise mostly distracting because while accidentally touches that it goes to that link its a privacy issue that it may stolen by an unknown person. Please note this,negative
Looks like a hybrid app which downloads the webpages as is. Takes a long time to load searches and search results clicked.,neutral
"App is not developed using native code, instead developed using WebView , which causes it to overheating phone and slow app after using it for a while. You are such a big company, why can't you get an native app ?",negative

1. Questions are too repeatative and also the topics. After a while it start feeling stagnant and I am losing interest. Their search and Recommendation bot is very poor in terms of suggestions and gathering data. 2. Very slow operation and takes too much time open app as well as any function in the app. Infact on slow net it doesn't even open. 3. Moderator policy is below below below average. Can't even write about wrong answers or comments. 4.Qoura has more commercial with ads n poor content,negative
"Fix your app! It takes so long to load answers on my mobile, and sometimes my keyboard stops responding when I'm writing answers. I remember using this app a few months ago and it didn't had these issues.",negative
It is very importance app üòä üëå for every men .it is a learning app too. I am very interested when I started these app,positive
This is very good app this is give me answer is very fast and this is no any problem in THIS app this is very help me in my homework and other thing and please download to all of you,positive
"I've rated this as 1-star because I cannot assign zero! I posed a question on Quora on my phone and left the screen on to keep an eye out for answers. When I refreshed the page, I found that some letters had randomly inserted themselves into my words. For example, instead of ""What"", it now read ""Whdbfnwkat"". So I figured I had accidentally done something so I edited the question and made sure I didn't touch it again. Again when I went to refresh the page, the entire question had been changed.",neutral
"1.Slow and has lots of bug 2.It does not has the auto selection topic when you post a question, the user finds difficulty in selecting the topics.",negative
It used to be a good app but after past few updates the app sucks.it doesn't load more answer and always it shows loading. Searching an answer take infinite amount of time .,negative
A great platform to get and share knowledge. The only issue is the loading speed. Will change my ratings to 5 star when it will be solved.,positive
"Quora is amazing but the Android app is incredibly slow. It has all the functionality you need, but because it's so sluggish, I get frustrated and stop using it (browser is so much faster). Also not the biggest fan of how there is no public API, even just for retrieving personal data and supplementing the user experience. I hope both of these issues get fixed soon.",negative
Its a shame that it is becoming too slow now. Answers dont open upon clicking. Feel like pulling my hair out waiting for it.,negative
The latest update of Quora is worst because in spaces if we share another answer then it doesn't show that this answer already exist in the space if we have shared this answer in the space earlier. This is worst thing that it is now not showing whether the answer is present or not in that particular space. Please update it. It is really frustrating and disgusting.,negative
"Beware, this us a spammer. I did a search to clarify a grammar question and really liked the answer. I thought quora would be helpful in the future for this type of inquiry but found it is more of a chat hub, with questions asked and answered. I have uninstalled and reset all my quora notifications online to off. Still getting daily emails which I turn off the notifications for. Next day, another one, different subject. I am reporting it as spam now. This program is very hard to get rid of.",neutral
For every update the app loads slowly. I am unable to open any posts when i use mobile data,negative
"I know a lot goes into development of apps but somewhere somehow your app doesn't act like how it should. I have a great enough deceive to run many applications in split screen and it still doesn't freeze up, black out or force close. Quora is the first. I am gracefully uninstalling the app and using web instead.",negative
One of the best apps I have ever come across. But the app gets slower after the first few minutes. It behaves like its a heavy app and my device doesnt have enough RAM.Please fix that.,negative

"Bc, this app shows tinder ads, I came here to focus on my goal, not to get distracted because of your ads...üòí",negative
So I was thinking that my phone was old as the battery was disgcharging at an alarming rate. Turns out the app was pulling 33% of it in background. I like Quora but whats the point of having an app at this point if i can go to website.,negative
App becomes very slow nowadays. Today i have uninstalled it and decided to read ans only from my browser.,negative
"This app used to be one of the best app . But , now it has become too much irritating , too much lagging , there are many issues . Rules are strict but app maintenance is not strict . Please fix it . So we can use it smoothly .",negative

"I am not reviewing about functionality of app , i am telling about quora only, At a time in past, 80 percentage of my lots doubts are clarified through quora only.",neutral
Won't work on Pixel 4a. The navigation bar will be off and most interactions will simply not work.,negative
"Quora is a nice concept but the way it is set out and organised is pretty stupid. I dont want to have to scroll passed 10 unrelated articles just to get to the answer to the question, half the time it's hard to tell if you're selecting the answer or you click and end up on a different thread altogether and lose the one you actually wanted.",negative
"Relatively open dialogue; no bandwagon pile ons or compulsive flagging; rare police actions are Q & A friendly and not entirely subjective. Very international membership and trends more mature overall. Popular meandering 'story teller' style is not ideal for quick reference or indexing and esteemed by pseudo intellects. Overall generally pleasant, stimulating and sometimes fun app for text-info traders.",positive
App is good but from last four days whenever i ask a question in quora hindi i am not getting suggestion list to tag peoples. Mailed quora three times about it but didn't get anything esle than a thanks for contacting us notification.,negative
"I'd give a 0. Wanted to look at a few q&a's but made me sign up. Made me pick 10 interests when i didn't want to pick any. Made me join 5 groups-i dont know these groups, dont wanna join.

"THIS IS THE FIRST APP FOR WHICH I'M GIVING ONLY ONE STAR ALTHOUGH I WANTED TO GIVE 0! Your moderators are trash that do not allow the freedom of speech, I didn't do anything against your policies so don't send me that stupid policy link everytime I try to explain something. It's been a month or something since I'm using this and my experience was not good at all! My first question was removed just because a cracked a joke in it? I hope quora will be replaced by an alternative.",negative
"1)Too laggy and slow. The website is better than the app. 2)My questions get answered but I don't get notified (In the app). 3)I face a lot of trouble while editing anonymous answers. Too laggy, no option to insert an image/format the text. 4)Answers don't show up on the main answer page although they weren't deleted/reported and are there in the Question Log. 5)Changes to anonymous questions are made instantly but editing a public question which I had asked myself is sent for review! üòíüòë",negative
"How do you stop notifications? Actually the answer is simple - just uninstall the app. Seriously, there were something like 40 widgets to turn of for notifications and the same again for emails. I just wanted a master switch to turn it off. In the end you can find it when you hold the app icon for a second and click ""uninstall"". The end.",negative
One of the worst optimised apps... The content is the selling point of the app but the optimization and UI sucks big time. Please fix it ASAP!,negative

Well i found it interesting and download it but my problem is that its so slow on Android and its kinda Annoying but i guess this app is really interesting,positive

From last month the app doesn't load anything or loads at an impossibly slow rate god knows why And no it's not a problem with my device or net speed(it's 50mbps),negative

Used to be good but I only get single page answers in my recommendations now a days. Its very painful to scroll through those answers where I have little interest in. They should work on improving their recommendation algorithm. Also the app is very buggy and is very irritating to use. Every app seems to progress forward but its opposite with quora right now.,negative
Everytime there is internal server error or some other excuse. I want to uninstall it but there is no other alternative.,negative
Not able to download app onto android. App installation too slow. One star rating is a generous rating. Looking forward to improvements to Quora. Will still use internet to look things up on Quora because it has good information so far but the competition has the upper hand for now.,positive
I used to love the app before. But now it takes forever to load content so much so that it's better to use chrome than your app. You give article suggestions and then when the user wants to read the app tales easily more than a minute,negative

The app is just too slow. Improve its speed and the experience would be great.,negative
"Quora is absolutely hopeless. It's moderators act with considerable bias, often acting without any discernible logic or pattern. Many of the questions are of dubious provenance, and after the ""system"" detects certain interests of the account holder, questions, posts, and comments, clearly targeted to that individual, miraculously appear. F.C.C., information, states that this cannot happen, just by editing an individual feed, nor should it. When I look at my content, there are discrepances",negative

So many years into the business still this app doesn't work smoothly! Same old speed lags a lot.,negative
"Great place for public opinion and professional answers. The website and app are a real mess to navigate; I never know if I'm commenting on a post or someone else's comment. I think you have to answer or comment on your own question just add more details. Notifications are not sorted at all, and searching for my content only shows the times a moderator berated me for some absurd reason, like providing a last name.",negative
This app is not compatible with autorotate; does not support split screen. It is worse than browser version but still forced on users.,negative

A disgusting tactic, indeed. Goodbye Quora App, I lived without before, and I can do it again.",negative
It is too difficult to ask a question on this app. Also it takes a lot time to load. didn't like this app. Uninstalling it.,negative

The app is so slow even if I has a good connection. Sometimes it would take minutes to load contents.,negative
Though its really good as it suffices all our queries but it is extremely slow ...plzz improve it..,positive
The platform has become like facebook... The app tries to give you notification to the question which you have read... and currently they show fews lines of it in notifs...to lure you... professional answers are overshadowed by the people who crave upvotes and follows...

"The app is good. Informative and Useful. The issue is with the refresh rate and opening. Even though it is not a bulky app, it behaves like it and even in the higher Ram enable phone. I don't know about Apple devices but in Android its frustrating to use. Try to make it more reliable by making it light and fast. And if possible make the app little sorted and arranged. After opening, it feels like the app was stuck in a quake and all the contents just got scattered.",negative
Quara is good but recently I noticed many fake or misleading informations are spreading through Quara across the globe. Especially biased or hot topics. Right answers are always found below not in the top.,negative

As compared to website your mobile app is too much slow. Actually it is very very very slow. You should focus to optimise your mobile app as much as you can. Because if your app is super slow then it makes a huge impact on users mind. So I hope I can see this update on your next update. Because this is must for your app and good for users. üòä Thanks,negative
i dont remember when was the last time this app worked well ? it isnt showing the new notifications if i want to see the upvotes or comments on my answer i have to go to my profile. sometimes it dosent work on mobile data u have to turn on WIFI then it will work. seriously guys you need to work harder on this app.,negative

Way too time consuming for any app let alone one that is used casually or hardly at all.",negative
"It's a data consuming app which takes a lot of time to get loaded inspite of being on the 4G network .This app needs to be optimised so that the user experience is improved.

Just one more thing to get into and realize ive gone to 30 different places never filling the first goal or question i was looking for. As if my A.D.D. isn't bad enough.

"WHY QUORA DOESN'T CARE? Without downloading this app reading Quora was a pleasure. The app is unreasonably slow and keeps readers unduly frustrated.

Please, Improve or stop this app.",negative
Super slow loading üêå even on super fast internet please fix this issue ‚ö†Ô∏è it makes the experience worse,negative
"The app should ensure that it's a genuine place for good questions and answers. Instead of that it's seen as more of petty useless questions in life, filled with fake profiles and useless political trash talk.

Very informative and I spend hours on it. The website could use a little work. You have to keep drilling down to get to the actual story. Otherwise very enjoyable.,positive
"I love Quora, but this app is way too big. I had to delete it from my phone as it was taking up too much space for something I just use sometimes.",negative
"It's alright, I used to enjoy it more. Issue is that people are making money asking questions but not for answering them. There are thousands of repeat questions, not even rephrased. It is supposed to be proper English only but it isn't and then there are people who get crazy with corrections. There are minors who should not be on here. My biggest issue is this, if typing the question in google nets a positive and absolute answer to a well known question and answer it shouldn't be asked here",negative
Ohhh my god... this app is very very very slow. I can't even add a comment in quora and pages are not loading when I click readmore. I have a good 4g Internet speed. My other apps are working good. Try to fix otherwise it's good app.,negative
This is the worst app and this is very slow all time is wasted in buffering. Don't download it needs a lot of improvement.,negative

"This particular app has deteriorated over the past couple of years. It started a bit glitchy but was okay. Then last year I noticed a bit of lag in loading but was still fine with it since I loved the Quora as a platform. Then I didn't got a chance to use Quora much over the last 10-12 months and now that I am back, I have been struggling to find a reason to not uninstall it. The app takes around 10-20 seconds to open any option after clicking. It's just painful to see Quora app die now.",negative
The best app for enhancing your knowledge and clearing your doubts. I am a student of chartered accountancy course and this app just helped me so much in deciding my career field and connecting with my peers.,positive
Initially I've gave 5 Stars to this app but now I am giving it 2 why? Because of the new update with greyish dark mode. I get it that they say it saves almost same amount of battery as perfect black pixels in amoled but what we are not here for saving battery we are in the era of 6000 Mah battery capacity. Atleast you guys should add options for amoled black like reddit did. I just hate the greyish dark mode in amoled.,negative
Lame! The app does not work at all.. Its always down and keeps asking for an update.,negative
"While I can read text in Questions and answers, it fails to render images as I scroll them. It is such a bad experience for me . I love Quora platform but answers that have images tend to render empty placeholders instead of the image itself. Please fix this, it sucks & hurts.",negative

Why do you introduce app ...if it is better to use web version....very poor performance.....improve the loading to faster..... make inbuilt dictionary,negative
Good to ask questions and request answers. But the one thing i hate is my feed. I request a section in settings menu to control my feed manually and notifications.,negative

"It's very much helpful and very informative, this is huge platform to share your experience and know all about world.",positive
I was hoping there would be a place you can see all your discussions you have had to keep track of them. I cant see the point of this app beyond what you do in a browser.,negative
This app contains both information and entertainment which most apps lack of but it comes at a price- frustration you will be casually reading everthing but suddenly it starts lagging(yes it does) and if it doesn't then the touch response won't work and the most frustrating part is when you find an intresting answer but because of the normal touch delay you will at the end get frustrated to see the answer. Great if you have a lot of time and control over every hormones.,negative
Was going good until they demanded that I use my full name which would put me in danger so I am deleting the program and canceling any membership.,negative
"Can be hard to navigate but it's all in all a good site for knowledge, support and answers.",positive

"I've been a quora user since past 5 years. I really liked the app initially but in recent months it has been acting very fishy. I repeatedly unsubscribed from the newsletters via the preferences settings page but still it keeps sending those letters. When I return back to unsubscribe again, the option to receive them gets restored on its own. In a few days, the app's UI has also been strange. The radio button that sets your preference on or off doesnt works upon clicking it. Please look ASAP.",negative
Earlier the app was pretty fast but now it's super slow and the Google redirects never work. Losing interest in reading answers when it takes this much time to load the pages.,negative
The app takes a lot of time to open. I'd rather use their website than this app.. Very very disappointing..,negative
2 simple reasons why only 1 star. 1. ads ads ads 2. Slow slow slow af app. You check it. Compared to other apps it's at least 3 times slower.,negative
"Need Light Versions of this app is more data consumed and take more storage , it is not so fast , also need more time than website use. This app do not properly after upgrade to new version.",negative
It wont let me use the website it forces you to go to the app and when it finaly lets you get to the website it is lagy and hard to do on the website so it forces you to go to the app then you have to do a fricken survey and it shoves it down your throat you forced to do then you have to reshearch it in google then you get even more lag so you have to ahearch it up in the app amd try to find it and even after all of that i wont find what im looking for and all of this for A SINGLE question,negative
This is indeed a good app but i give it 1 start. Because it doesn't work in our country. It needs vpn which is not acceptable.,negative
Great app...it's a ocean of knowledge but the speed is too slow. I use a 4g network and it just buffering nothing else...to slow servers... I prefer using the Quora website because it's faster than the app,negative
This is a cool app to spend time on and is very informative and helps improve oneself and one such kind of social media app that I don't feel guilty about spending some time on..,positive
Going to become next dating and entertainment app. Quora statred as a knowledge sharing platform but Quora team now slowly converting it into a entertainment app full of fake stories with no respect for genuine writers. Medium and Reddit is far better for knowledge enhancement.,negative
The app doesn't load sometimes when I open it even though the internet is working. I use marshmallow. Fix it and it'll be 5 stars all the way.,negative
I love Quora but it can be a bit confusing due to all of the adds. I also wish it would show only what you follow and nothing more.,negative

"The worst app ever. The search results don't work, the AI is worst not to mention the unease of access not at all user friendly literally Quora has become one of the worst platform and I am hoping a new platform emerges.",negative
App is ok But when i am using in browser it will automatically refreshing and due to this i lost my previous content. Please solve this,negative
Use web instead the app. A very good idea badly executed with lot's bugs in the app. Loading is slow and text formatting tools don't work in that way. And there's nothing to check the quality of contents people can write anything they want without proper mention of source and references which sometimes create conflicts.,negative
"Don't know why the site forces you to login into the app if you want to see more questions. To add insult this app doesn't even work. Keeps saying my account activity has been halted and ""this may be an error. Please contact Quora"" without giving me any way to contact them",negative
"I like the concept of this app. However, it so slow that it's impossible to remain inside the app. Seriously why is it so slow that even a turtle is faster than this app. Developer should seriously work on the app. Otherwise quora will lose its advantage.",negative

Very useful.. Actual information from experienced persons . Right now best app. Though facing little bit issues on loading & refreshing # high latency.,positive

Worst app ever. Takes so much time in loading I could never wait for content to load and ended up deleting the app on first day Total BS!,negative
"Amazing app. But it would be great if you can give an option of DARK THEME as it will be cosy for our eyes and would save extra battery which will be proportional in spending more time in the app. Thank you. Edit,: Thanks for dark mode.",positive
It's a shame that quora doesn't have landscape mode for tablets. A simple feature which is very essential. It's surprising that no one thought about this.,negative
App isn't user friendly. I accidentally used a different email from the one I intended to. Now I can't use the one I want to. Enough if I logout it would still remain the same,negative
There was a time I was unhappy with this app. I loved google+ but they went away. Quora can jump gun. Place something in your app that was not you. Otherwise happy. Seems you get answeres. Prefer phone,negative
"Quora could be a good tool in terms of knowledge transfer. Unfortunately, on many, many occassions the truth is quenched altogether by very ignorant persons who have no idea of the noted topics and discussions; this includes the Quora moderation system and its actual moderators. So, given their lack of understanding, coupled with personal bias against topics with no quatitative substantiation, correct answers are erroneously deleted.",negative

"Hey Quora, Your service is commendable but I am ashamed to say that considering your app, When I installed it, it was working so slowly that it bothered me a lot, I urge you to give us something good like other companies, We don't need an app like this, I have to apologize for it.",negative
"Although it is very good app and an ocean of knowledge but it is very slow. Even in 4G network it behaves like 2G. If we try to see any question, answer, posts, our profile or someone else's,etc it takes 4-5 seconds even if our internet speed is 4-7mb/sec. I think this is a problem that must be resolved. Thanks",negative
"I would have given it 5 stars, but what the hell is wrong with experts or app i dono, no one answered my single question(not repeated), 2 months have been passed since no answers i got so irritated... so i suggest you to keep the team of specialized field experts who are within ur app and work for quora and its users, so that they can answer us quickly.",negative
"I love the app, but lately I've been blocked from answering or posting questions, I very rarely indulge in posting anything I usually only like to spectate so I don't really understand why I've been blocked",negative
App is super slow and the app looking more complicated and the suggestion of new questions is not good.,negative
"Other than the fact that it just works, and works well, the content is what I believe social media, or the connectivity of humans globally should be about. Mostly devoid of political rhetoric, there are powerful and poignant stories which leave you with a sense of gratitude and awe. I find it a refreshing change from mainstream social media and I have learned a lot through the articles.",positive
"All of the problems with the ads and stuff like that? Have ALL been downgraded. So, therefore now that is? This app deserves a 5 star review from me, personally. üòä",positive
"It's good for reading. A good time pass. The thing is, it doesn't allow negative comments. If I want to show that I don't like one story or article, I should get the freedom to do it. Otherwise a good app...but pls solve my problem, hags...or my mind would change..",positive
"The app is working great now, but don't increase the megabyte size of the app anymore, this will make the app work much smoother",positive

I am having great net connection, every other app works fine, but when it comes to quora, it just loads and again loads like I am using 2G data connection.. Improve it guys...!!!!!",negative
"Not a fan of the waiting periods and insistence I provide my PII. Easier to search via Google outside of this app for articles than it is from inside Quora. They seem very controlling while some of their users, content providers, have free reign to post a lot of junk, poorly written, and time wasting.",negative
Nothing opens when it asks to update. When it has an update you have to update it. No matter how important your work is or in how much hurry you are.,neutral
"The information is amazing and the concept is really good. But the app is too laggy, sometimes it automatically closes, sometimes I've written a long answer with alot of hard work and it's all gone because of app abruptly closing down. There are also many many technical issues which has made this app not usable for me even though I would love to use it whole day.",negative
Why i try this app ? It has too many ads. And i know quora forcing me to install their app but i can't install just because of ads. Before the app i was using the web version with a beautiful ad blocker and totally satisfied with the performance. No way.,negative
Very very slow .It should be rebuilt immediatly because this is very useful. Older versions were better.pls fix the problem Again and again it remains very slow,negative
It was a bad experiance.....first if all the connectivity and bug issues are worse than the web version and lots of crashes,negative

I want to give infinite stars but there are only five stars.all the best quora..",positive
Not great. You should put a sensitive content option. So tired of seeing graphic images and stories all over the feed. It's toxic to look at those things if I accidentally open the app first thing in the morning. Also dead bodies and what now. Also unnecessary notifications and ton on unnecessary emails,negative
It asks you to follow 10 topics. Then sub topics. After I did that it went back to select 10 topics again. So I went through the steps again and same thing happened. Uninstalled ! I'll just use the website !,negative
App lags too much even after having good internet connection. Sometimes I get irritated while opening any article. Developers should work on its smooth working.,negative
"The app is very good and easy to use. It does not create any problem while operating and has a decent interface. One thing which I did not like is that in my Galaxy Tab A 10.1, whenever I click an answer, the answer does not get minimized and I have to scroll through several answers which I opened and reach the next question. Please kindly fix this issue or tell how to fix this as there is no option in the settings which is responsible. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars",positive
"No stars for app glitchiness. Comments fill with errors as the app is constantly refreshing in the background. It becomes a chore to comment. Unable to edit any original posts once you hit send, so you have to live with typos. They arbitrarily remove comments, not because they violate anything, but because *they* don't like it. After this last removal, I'm done. I used to use the app daily, stopped because there's no rhyme or reason to removing posts and I'm not in grade school any more.",negative
"It's actually a pretty good app but, I always got temporarily blocked I don't know why. They said that its because I used a fake name. But it's my real name and I connected it in one of my real google accounts, I don't get it. Now I'm temporarily blocked again for that reason and it's kinda irritating. And also how are you supposed to know if my name is fake or not, it's my name lol. I wish you could fix this problem, this is the only problem I have. Thankyou.",negative
Best app to get any type of answer to your questions. You can clear your doubts by reading each and every answer posted there.,positive
This app is good and very useful. I used vivo 1609 mobile. This apo is operate very very slow in this model and notification not open. Plz resolve it.,positive

I had no choice but to uninstall this a few days later cause my inbox flooded with their emails; even after I'd changed the settings by turning off ALL notifications. Occasionally some articles & topic threads piqued my interest but then I'd feel annoyed & frustrated having to weed through the obtrusive advertisements.

Best platform for getting your answers and also it helps a lot for honest reviews and information. Yet there are some fake and violent peoples who spread hatred and wrong information. Just beware of them. But also there are lots of great people who gives quite good information. Thank you quora for giving such plarform for everyone.,positive
Very bad experience in loading .... Takes too much time and you loose all your interest in the content,negative
"Normally I wouldn't rate apps. But Quora once used to be an addictive app for me. Now it's dead slow, really hard to type answers as it's crashing the app every 15 minutes and the content are way too repeated. The algorithm needs to be altered a little and optimise the quality content. Make it like good old days.",negative
Best platform to gain knowledge But it is very slow....it takes a lot of time to load new pages. Hope you resolve the issue making it a 5 star app.,negative
The UX is somehow confusing. I found it difficult to navigate through posts and comments.,negative
Best app i always have problems searching with google coz they will not give me the main point but this is the best app so you can figure out what is right .. download it ..im glad that it has narutos question too preeetyyyyy aweesssomeee,positive
Not good. Only graphics and looks are good but navigation questions and answer framework is worse.,negative

Was better when starred. Genuine answers. Now it seems the platform is being used for more of a leftist agenda than balanced and nuanced answers. Moderaters seem to weild the whip here. I wish it remains a neutral platform or Quora will loose its sheen.,negative
"The new update is so bad contains so many links it is annoying to use. Your feed will have more links than it will have answers. Moderators are absolutely biased, worst app on play store.",negative
It is getting horrible by the day. Good stories getting lost and nonsense up. Uninstalled it today. Bye bye.,negative
"I used spend time on Quora, but given its compromised and biases content review makes me wonder if it has been always that way or I just now realised it.",negative
It was a good platform but now bans popular and honest writers. The platform comes across as very biased towards certain communities and content,negative
Biased and prejudiced towards a specific section of people.. masquerading as a question and answer app but is highly biased with extremist agendas... Not something I would recommend to a person with a stable mind..,negative
Not helpful. Doesn't give a whole and complete ideas of things. Needs a lot of improvement.,negative
It has become a biased platform over the years. Its moderation deletes the answers which are factually correct.,negative
Website's slow. Way too many ads spoiling reading experience. The digest shows content about three months back and not the latest one.,negative
"1. LaTeX doesn't work properly in Dark mode 2. Dark mode is really bad. You guys have just put a temporary dark colored layer over white mode. Because of this, the white background flashes for a few seconds before the it is covered with the dark mode layer. Please use an actual dark mode like any other app which uses a dark mode. A separate dark mode which has nothing to do with light mode.",negative
Like many social media platforms that advocate 'free speech' only on paper. Quora moderation is biased and agenda driven like most modern platforms are.,negative
"Biased platform. Answers collapse only specific section..... Well it's digital era... They can do anything they want but not dictate our thinking. I was searching for negative rating but the minimum rating is one star so..,..",negative
"A platform that has become so biased towards Indians and Hinduism. There is so much of bashing, hatred and false propaganda being promoted in this platform. It has become more left leaning",negative
"Two experiences, One about app and second Quora. Let me start with app. Almost bugged into installing app. When using Quora through browsers, would keep getting reminders to download app which could never be removed. Finally, downloaded app. Nothing too different from web access which made this app easier to use, except absence of annoying reminder. Regarding Quora itself, become another Leftist propaganda. Biased BNBR policy used by moderators against inconvenient answers/replies. Deserves 0 *",negative
"Biased platform. Probably has an editorial board that is actively biased. Mostly innocuous for general topics, but us extremely biased when it comes to religion and such issues. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.",negative
Biased platform I'm using it from last 4 years but now they have shown their true colours. And spreading communal violence. üñïüñïüòí,negative
"Initially, it was good to read the articles. But of late, leftists and radical islamists have taken over the platform (possibly in the administration too). It is extremely biased. While hate speech against hindus and india are tolerated, anything that is factual about leftists and radical Islamists is taken out. One more platform that has been subjugated by radical leftists and islamists.",negative
For answer writers it is like a hellbound and to most of the times while reading answers it refresh and never found again...worst app one side policy,negative
"The app is really buggy and nowadays you see too many promoted contents. It now totally a biased platform wherein the moderators supress your post. Looks like they have an agenda to support hinduphobic post and collapse your post, if you try to bring out the truth.",negative
"I've been using this platform for more than 5 years, and honestly this app has only seen decline, in quality of answers as well as bugs in the app. Their moderators are left wing, not allowing free speech for rightists. Content is just deteriorating, with memes and body-showing getting more visibility than quality answers.",negative
An utterly disgracefull unworthy app. The moderation sucks. If thing dont change now for sure this app in future is going to lose its users.,negative
"It USED to be good with good policues and good content....i miss the good answers of some amazing people but now it just wont show....tried downvote,tried not interested...no effect...just chane the name to quoragram",negative
"Okayish app now. Experience degrading with time, it used to be good earlier. Highly biased moderation.",negative
It use to be an informative app but it is very much biased towards a culture and which made to leave them. I used to love the app but unless they change their moderation. We would like to boycott it,negative
"Highly biased hinduphobic platform. Here you are allowed to write anything thing against Hindus and Hinduism but dare not to say anything about Islam. Even the word ""Islamophobic"" get your content deleted.",negative
"I used to love Quota when I'd search something on the web. Since downloading the app, it has been quite disappointing. I thought it would be more user friendly and it is not. They blocked me from commenting cause of my name which is my real name by the way. The suggested questions are either old, irrelevant, or extremely ignorant. 90% of the questions are political nonsense. Its like they let 10 year olds ask political questions, my gosh it is horrible.",negative
"The idea behind the app is really good. But Quora moderation is extremely biased and bad. So, many good writers are leaving or being shut down due to poor moderation. I just wish that Quora management takes some concrete action on this.",negative
"Biased writers, worst policy for writers and promotes anti India agenda. Was using quora from past 7 yrs but now It has changed a lot and not a right place to spend your valuable time.",negative
No doubt it's a nice app. But what I found is its baised also and promote anti-hindu contents. If something which is against India or Hindu it's ok but if it's the reverse then your content will be removed. Quora I am really disappointed. Support freedom of speech from both side or else no side.,negative
App is complete biased for one idiology. Moderator need to check on it. And to be unbiased.,negative
"Mostly filled with misinformations. When you report some objectionable content they won't utter a word, but when you post truth with documents supporting your claim they will instantly delete your account. Also they are anti-hindu in nature.",negative
"Used to be a good platform for learning but nowadays it has become a really filthy place. No supervision and even if there is, it seems to be biased, now more than ever. People used to write awesome,witty answers here, all of them have left most of them have moved to Medium or somewhere else. Now, it has just become one of those copy paste answering websites.",negative
worst app hangs roo much.. whenever try to open some content it takes forever..dont know for what they are updating their app!! in starting it was best later its becoming worse day by day...cant open content in browser too nowadays..it will prompt to use app i would not even give it one star.. frustrated!!üòëüòëüò°,negative
"Fully biased and fake information is allowed, genuine information is blocked and collapsed. I used to love this app. Uninstalling this app and have to look for alternative.",negative
"It is surely not a neutral platform , very severely left biased . For me twitter which is left wing biased is more better than this It's only support answers which are left leaning in every topic",negative
"Uninstalling. Great premise, but cheesy, misleading clickbait articles for advertisements? I choose not to subject myself to the Jerry Springers of internet articles.",negative
"It has become a very biased app, coz' it hide truth and show only unnecessary things...It prohibits the users to write truth and even block or suspend the space or handle of the writer",negative
Quora app sucks!! Images doesn't load in the app even after having stable internet connection. I'm facing this problem from last 2 months.,negative
"I am revisiting my review as it has dawned that Quora is highly biased, leftist and anti-Hindu. It looks like China and left has bought over my beloved Quora. See my review earlier, have learnt so much... But I think time has come to uninstall it Quora has been my best friend for quite some time now. The content available is truly amazing. Makes me realize how much there is, to learn, enjoy....",negative
The app doesn't support split screen? This is not 2015. Virtually every all supports it. I don't see why this app can't.,negative
Good app but it takes time when switching from web to application. It should have dark theme feature which make easier for readers. It also should add copy and search the words seamlessly with browser.,positive
"Day by day contents are getting worse. Feel like un installing the app. Instead of making this platform educational, entertaining and informative, its getting to be a place where any sicko can write anything he or she wants to. Really getting worse day by day. Please buckle up your quality.",negative
Most of the downloads are from people who can't access the broswer version of this app. This is a waste of space. Pathetic forced app,negative
"I really enjoy Quora but the app is clunky. Often hard for me to find what I want because of all the ads and suggested posts. They really need to clean up the interface. Make the answers stick out from the suggestions and ads etc. I do use dark theme so maybe that has something to do with it, but that would need addressed as well if that is the case.",negative
"I like the concept and the platform but recently I've been noticing that they're biased in actually Implementing their policies when it comes to certain topics. One example is True Indology, there was no reason to ban his/her account.",negative
The best app for asking any doubt and about current affairs. The best app i have ever seen. The main reason I gave 5 stars is that the explanations are very good and nice,positive
"I have found a lot of interesting information about certain subjects, that before installing this app, I didn't know or understand much about. Most of the people who also use this app, are quite full of experience in the field that is being discussed & most people are very nice and practical, friendly towards other people. I've only had one bad experience with a particular type of person but I have blocked as they were quite rude & as it was the first time I'd used this app.",positive
"I love this app!! It has helped me through so much of life's hurdles from how to disconnect my car battery to what to do in w/ my teenager regarding a sensitive subject!! It's also good for general entertainment purposes in many areas jokes, random facts, dating, etc. You wont be sorry you downloaded it I promise!! Especially during this time of social distancing!!",positive
"Very informative. I was getting way too many emails from it, but I was able to change my subscriptions to limit emails to once a week, great.",positive
You should correct this app because it has loading problem.Most of the time i have to open the app more than one time just because it does not load contents.More over when i switch back to other back putting this in background and again open it from background then it again starts loading and never load anything untill i destroy it and re-lauches it.,negative
Really Helpful to solve any concern with different logic.. Always read all answers of every Question and connect with world..,positive
"Works, but lots of fanatics there, pushing their biased views, can be addictive in a bad way",negative
"Worst app ever. Always shows one sided answer. It's control by some peoples who is against that topic. Full negative place. For e.g., if someone had askwd question related to goverment, they shows bad side always. Worst app in whole play store.",negative
"At first the app was great. It was working perfectly- I could comment, answer, follow people, like comments but all of that stopped. It doesn't respond to anything I try to do anymore even though I have an account. I just uninstalled the app. Maybe it'll start working again after re-installing. I'll try a few more things to get it to work...after that I'm done if it doesn't go back to normal.",negative
User interface is still buggy Not even worthy app to be here Better to use browser version. Same as before.. Update what's the use,negative
It does help to get many answers as there are many people around.....unlike other social apps it keeps people on social platform but with full privacy.,positive
Most biased app I've ever used. Besides that this app unbearably slow for such a light app. I can literally open a heavy and close it back while this app is loading something. At least fix this issue. We know that you can't fix hypocrisy in your app. To the users out there use browser instead of this app. It's way more faster than this app.,negative
I continue to want to use the app & i go back & use it. Four times now. But i find it too much. Almost overwhelming.,negative
"The app is informative , but refreshing is a very big problem , it even takes a lot of time to load, 1 start might be a little too generous",negative
"Not certain if this is down to the app or their server, but often it seems to freeze, especially when opening a post that you want to respond on.",negative
The app work too much low speed and it takes lot of effort to get answers to questions and unable to view notifications...,negative
You cant use this app without updating it. It has more updates than im used to and stupid sarcastically answers should be removed from site its wasted time anf energy when your relying on a legitimated anwser,negative
It is a good app for information but the app is quite slow. I have very fast internet connection and a good smartphone but this app takes much to load. That is it's bad point.,negative
"Quora is good source of knowledge. But now a days, it is working very slow. Please improve. It is very irritating to use. I shall give 5 star if it work as per internet speed but due to very low speed only 2 star.",negative
This app is changed someI don't like the fact that when you look up stuff on this you have to get the app to keep looking at I don't like the fact that you makes you do that and it used to be all that you know write all the stuff or whatever now I think they shut that down so anything I don't like about it other than that I love it good information and I learned more stuff that you know about and find more stuff that I know about it's kind of like stumble upon check that out you might like it,negative
"Can't figure most of it out. Maybe if you had a tutorial, that may score you some extra stars. Not giving up yet though, hope to give more stars soon.",neutral
There was just an article I wanted to read on their site ‚Äî but I couldn't do this unless I sign up and pick 10 topics I'm interested in ‚Äî so obtrusively and time wasting! Mess,negative
"Humble request to Quora developer - Don't experiment too much with UI. Evwrytime I update app, just to find out new UI and new learning curve to use it. I find current UI good enough to settle down.",neutral
"I've learned a lot here. There are so many experts here to answer your question with sources and links, it's a class operation. You can get opinions of that's all you want. Or you can get a history lesson or a how to lesson from anything to zoology.",positive
It is satisfying to express my views and opinions. However some inappropriate drawings and photos make the Quora looks dirty which is highly objectionable. I wish Quora should edit such photos before publishing. I am leaving Quora only for this reason.,negative
Very slow and it's irritating . It takes so much time to load an answer. Please fix it,negative
"Overall a good app but i have some problems with moderation and biasedness of the moderators and i hope u will look into it my suggestion would be to remove moderators , Thanks.",negative
"Its informative sometimes, occasionally it can be entertaining, and quite often it's a great place to ask a question (as long as it's not too personal or your reason for living depends on the answer, you are asking strangers after all). But it can just as often devolve into something worthy of a Championship Title match with the YouTube comment section for the Undisputed Heavyweight ""Most Racist/Hateful/___phobic Comment"" Champion of The World!",positive
"I was asked to download this app so they can show the picture of my two cats after I left a message about them. I was told today that it was accepted and when I looked at it, it showed what I typed about the picture but not the picture.",neutral

"It's really app to use once but now it's really horrible. Please work on the slow progress issue, it's irritating a lot.",negative
Doesn't help and asks for updates when needed the most. Stubborn app doesn't let me use my browser.,negative
"Sometimes hangs while writing questions as well as answers. Also, when using dark mode, the answers appear in light mode. It's occurring since last update. Please rectify at the earliest.",negative
This app and the website are garbage just like Yahoo answers. I have them blocked on PC from showing in Google search results now if I could just do the same with mobile. May have to use a different browser besides chrome to achieve this.,negative
Good. But I gotta point out an issue. It leaves the Comment Reply field available to inform only when you click Send that you don't have permission!!! You write the text for no reason.,negative
Lots of propaganda from various countries. But lots of interesting stuff too,neutral
Always helpful! Especially helpful with helping me understand and learn more about narcissism and the effects it has on the victims of narcissistic people like myself!,positive

Even though my internet is fast and works well with other apps it takes a lot of time to load in this app,neutral

"Slower than website, takes lot of time to open and close tabs even when internet is good.",neutral
The app is not working as it used to be. When I read a post and came out to read another its simply not responding to my touch. I had to close and reopen the app to recognize my touch.,negative

"Over couple of years now, it's very hard to keep track of comments, answers and really understand audience around self created content. It's perhaps policy to make life difficult for content creators. Done..more of a waste of time now, and also taken over by trolls mostly too left",negative
I find this app very useful in getting advice from people more knowledgable than Me. It also has an obession with narcisism and my feed is always full of references to it so I can't tell if its referring to Me or what the hell its coming from.,positive
I loved the app but if it would make an option to download data-page for offline reading then it would be best & everyone would admire for it.. 3 stars only for now... later i will give 5 if that option is available for new update,positive
Terrible it wants u yo use ur real name and although I put in my real name it still refuse to work it acts like an app for 5 year olds it has interesting topics to read and interesting people,negative
"Being a curious human being, this app can do miracle consciously. A platform where anyone can aquire tons of ideas & knowledge subliminally.",positive

"App UI needs to improved a lot. It sometimes lags and delays are common.

"Too many knuckle draggers using it. If you want an intelligent logical discussion/argument then this is not the app for you. Train spotters would find this ideal.

Also, I can not see or leave comments under answers. I tried different accounts, I tried to figure out how your UI works, with no success.

It's a good app for reading questions and answers and has tons of information. The interface is great too. But it's just eh. It takes too long to load that I'll just use another app instead.

broken app and ads flooded. it might not be broken they intentionally let you download this app and when you click on browser redirect-thr qoura article that will show is not the one you clicked on. theyre worst dont buy premium,negative
"Very easy to use but sometimes when I want to write something and creating permalink that's not working properly. There are not a lot of possibilities to edit text as like H1 tags available on desktop site but not on app. I hope text editor also updated soon and some editor for images. Overall I like this app and ise it regularly. If this problems are fixed, that's will be useful for all. Thanks!",negative

Really useful app but its the slower among all other apps i have . Pls Fix this as soon as possible . Thnks,negative
I mean it's a good app but I dont like the real name policy. I dont want people to know my real name but at the same time I dont want to be anonymous. I would much rather just go by a username,negative
It's very great app. Has access to any question you ask and one can gain knowledge with the help of this app. There is a variety of topics to choose from and is very helpful.,positive

"Worstest ever . I changed my account names 3-4 times , even there wasn't a problem with my name , it's showing that i am blocked for asking. Only one question was my climax and starting.

"My guilty pleasure. I get sucked in for hours. Find out info on literally any subject under the sun from multiple sources who have experienced exactly what your looking to learn about. Ever wonder what it's like to do a certain job? Pros/cons, actual stories from actual people who do that particular job from a candid/no filter perspective. So many interesting stories and views from people from all walks of life. Love it. If you're gonna use social media, this one is at least good for your brain.",positive
This app is really slow and clunky . It is so frustrating to see that such an amazing website has such a sh**ty app. Please fix and optimise it . Also enable split screen cause it's is just making me go mad,negative
"Too many ads, answers seem questionable. If you like drama (how do I know if my husband is cheating on me?!) you might enjoy reading some answers, but it's much like a social media network such as reddit. The community votes to decide which answers are the best, but that doesn't mean much as these votes aren't coming from experts, and are likely driven by popularity and interest factors rather than factual reliability. You might as well just ask on reddit or Facebook.",negative
"Everything is broken, the links take ages to open, the upvote button works inconsistently. The app takes too much time to load.",negative
App is good and useful as well but most frustrating part is time taken to load things....it's ridiculously tooooooll slow....I feel like breaking my phone while waiting for it to load. ...Developers please work on it...it can be made to load easier and faster like others....,negative

Refuses to download newest version and no longer supported on older versions.,negative
"Being on quora since couple of years, it used to be more interesting with knowledge based Q&As, it had questions which had a topic of interest, but now algorithm is messed up or may be developing teams are loosing content controls. People are posting stupid questions, like why will a teenager ask about drugs or marijuana or s*x stuffs?",neutral
Great so far. Actually get answers to my questions and it doesn't take long to get a response. There are a million categories and im getting to like using the app more and more!,positive
"My advice: don't download it I used quora on my computer and liked it but the app didnt please me. After i hv scrolled down for a few minutes, it says something went wrong. It takes a great deal of time to go to the messages or to check any other thing. Use it on the web, the app sucks.",negative
First of all I wanna say thank you to Quora it's a very useful app it helped me alot socialing and provided lots of knowledge it never happened that I opened the app and I didn't get a new info . Today I am eligible to write answers too. I've learnt and now sharing it . I wanna inform you all that if it works slow don't get dissapointed . There is only one problem that Quora is having some unfamiliar informations these days by some new writers who claim that it's true . But it's a good app,positive
"This is the best application which i used since last years of protocol as it gives united information in blogs types which is very good for students as well as teachers too...... Thank you so much quora for helping this muchhh... Regars, A respected user...",positive
Excellent platform to share authentic ideas and experiences. We get very useful and true information here unlike the media.,positive

stop popping up in my phone screen. Its my choice whether i need to register and download the app or not. You can't fore us to sign in and install the app. Completly annoying you are. Reddit much better than your shity platform.,negative
"I mainly downloaded this app because I always look up random stuff, and this specific website is usually the one I tap on and read. It's usually just someone asking a particular question, another person looking up that question and answering with their response of what they've been through.",neutral
The notification system is somehow annoying! We have to turn off notifications manually for every topic we're subscribed to! And I've got some other languages added and guess what? Some more notifications coming right at you! Pleasee do something about it,negative
Awful experience using the app on Android. Most of the time the redirect doesn't work however quora is quite adamant in forcing to use the app.,negative
"The Q&A is fine. It's the app that takes a frustratingly long amount of time to load answers and I definitely feel it's getting slower by the day. Also the dark mode is not consistent - fails 2 times out of three (black text in dark grey background, if I reload then it turns to the light mode and only if I reload again then it is white text on dark mode).",negative
This idea behind Quora is great and so the app's content.But i'd suggest the develooer team to improve the user experience and some technical things in the app.,positive
"Aggressive, often controlling ad tactics and tricks of all the old and pernicious variety. If you love being distracted then this will certainly work for you.",neutral
"It's a great useful app . The best thing about it is people can express their ideas and thoughts, I would love to give more stars If I could . Really appreciate it",positive
"I write this review in the scant hope that somebody in Quora management would read it. That's because no option exists on Quora website to either contact them or get technical help or get answers to FAQs. I'm quite active in Quora, for several years, yet I could never figure out basic things such as including math in my answers or displaying my list of credentials. And there's nobody to ask and nowhere to find answers---except post a Quora question. Is that intentional? That's a disappointment.",negative
"The contents are helpful and interesting, and they helped me learn a thing or two daily. However, I'm not sure how the algorithm works. Some content are insighful, while the others are... Well, I feel like the answers are for the purpose of bragging only. Nevertheless, it's still an interesting app.",positive
It is really good app . it works good here is the store of knowledge. it gives u distinguished person experience and also other . anybody can use it in very simple way ..,positive
One of the best platforms to make recognition and also increase your knowledge. Edit: Spamming constantly to download the app while reading in browser version is very annoying.,positive
The app is not working properly. Please fix this. It is not loading information even with a stable and fast Internet connection,negative
This app is very very helpful for me to get my answer......I think this is very helpful for anyone who wants answer of any questions....It gives more ideas and many more.....for me QUORA IS THE BEST APP,positive

This app is really great for collectiNg any kind of information and this is best app in playstore for education is its 5 üåü but same times it's take time to load an pages and also themes was like old type üôèüôè,positive
"The app is super slow. You click on a question which takes half a minute to load. If you wanna read 10 different question, you was extra 5 mins which is annoying. So I was generally prevented by the app to read some Q&As I am interested in.",negative
I download the app beacuse i usally refuse to search random stuff and realted things and there are lot of information is geting through the app and it is user friendly and it work perfectly.,positive
"I want to give 5 stars, but why I give 4 stars? Because of, this app is super slow while browsing... I love‚ù§Ô∏è this so much and this is very useful for knowing a vast knowledge. But the slowing things are very unfortunaye. Very Sad üòì",negative
Really owesome app having a lot of useful information within the different posts. Loved it. It is a best time pass for gaining knowledge while using our phones in the free time.,positive
"It's an amazing app! I just wish I could attach a photo (i.e. screenshot or something from my camera or internet etc) to a question I have to help get an answer. It'd also be nice if you could unrequest people to answer your questions. I accidentally requested someone who I didn't want to answer my question and was not able to undo it. It'd also be nice to not only block and not see someone's answer to your question, but make it so no one else can either.",positive
Cannot open any link (and sometimes images) from the app! All space posts are rendered useless. Very buggy app.,negative
"Informative, mostly friendly place to ask questions. There are a lot of stupid questions though & notifications are enabled as soon as you follow something. Not sure what people are doing with their phones but I have no issues with loading pages or uploading images. Snapdragon 720G, 6GB RAM.",neutral

"Well The App is Good The Reasons for taking 2 starts is :- 1) Takes a lot of time of Load content even if Network connectivity is fair. 2) Lags in b/w Switching from feeds to Notifications. 3) UI seems complicated, try to improve it and make it better. 4) Gmail's Unsubscribing doesn't works! Sometimes its irritating. Hoping a Good Response in the next Update.",negative
"I better stay in the site, the app is so poor, doesn't even respond well for adds or buttons, and no dark mode, i can't read in bright background",negative
"Can't open any responses to questions or any articles some have written. The elements are interactive meaning if you click on a picture or response, the window changes color to signify confirmed input but nothing happens. No links open. I have to be lucky to read an article or two.",negative
"Compared to the other underlying competative offers being offered currently, Quora has rank has continually climbed in rankings despite the %#@$ involved. Thanks to them I can find answers to dispositions while also closing in on underlying expertise's . Catorgorized, calculated, expanding individual variables while still complelling and collecting concurrent documentation. Easy to use, while also answering any q&a while not interrupting current proposition.",positive
"Why this app always crashes While writing an answer? We spend hours for writing an answer and in a moment it disappears. And do you know what Dark Mode is? Dark Mode used for give relief on our eyes in night time by darkening screen, but your app darkening screen in day and brightening in night. Please fix this both in next update",negative
My favourite ‚ù§Ô∏è time passing app. It has huge collection of all types questions and answers and whenever u confused about anything just search on it you surely find something helpful. It helps me a lot üòä.,positive
Dear Developer's Why Not Dark Mode..!?? It feels more Comfortable to Access and bring more user to learn from your Amazing app...I am giving 1 star just because lack of dark Mode...It feels Irritating to eyes while all Major apps providing dark mode...Try to Consider the user Experience nd well being too...Hope u understand the Importance here.,neutral

"Very informative app,I learned a lot about human conditions and character from peoples answers.",positive
Its great app and website.. all the expert gives detailed answers of every question..but the only problem is that we dont get a short and fixed answers from them .i dont mean to say give one line two line ansers but i just want to say that define it not only explain..,positive
"I didn't got any one answer of mathematics. I think this is too boring app because you have to search for your answer many times, but you didn't got any perfect answer. Also it takes much time than that of google. Also it is too slow, it does not means my network is slow . For your information i am telling you to do not download this type of """"Rubbish"""" app....",negative
Sucks. No one like being forced. Why would I install this app to just to check some answers here and there. Edit:: Nice. Direct people to use buggy app and not letting them use browser where it loads perfectly. Good way to loose user base. Will not use it. Reddit is far better.,negative
"The app doesn't open stories or tabs it has bug have to force close app and re open, the stores would been refreshed or lost.",negative
Apps that force users to update frequently is annoying and an app with this much potential doing something like that eventually shows its incompetence. Poor feed maintenance and notification system.,negative
"Totally trashy app with disguise of knowledge, the answers are copy paste from Google and some answers are inaccurate and wrong.",negative
Quora is a really great invention. You get answers to your problem and you get to help others to solve their problems. Update - No option to add a hyperlink in the quora app. Even when a word is highlighted and the link is added in the hyperlink.,positive
"Keep crashing , alot of crashing, like it crashes whenever i touch the screen, its like an old engine that heats up after few mnts of running, ok updating now lets see Edit: getting better",negative
I am totally disappointed with current Layout. Q &A are formatted in worst layout ever. Like they are less important. Make it the same once it was,negative
"The articles are great, but the UI is trash. Too much lag, slower loading speed (even in 4G+) and WAY TOO MANY false touches. Clicking on an article would open an article adjacent to it, which wasn't even in the touching area of the screen! I find it so annoying. It also opens up ads sometimes instead of the intended articles. Also, the dark mode hasn't been well-implemented. Some searched articles get displayed in white or even grey background, making it impossible to read. Please fix these.",negative
"Pros: this sure is an app, alright. Cons: this has the exact same functionality as the mobile website, with one exception: the website will deny you access after you've scrolled down about 4 answers and demand you download the app. I don't want your app, Quora. I have 1.2m views on content I've written on your site. I don't understand why you object to my chosen medium for writing you free content that you monetize. Whatever you're hoping to get out of this app is suspicious at best.",negative
I'm still banned even after changing my name to a real one multiple times.There are also lots of bugs plus this app is slow.Trash bias app should have give -1000/10 smh.,negative
1 star less due to annoying notifications. You read one topic and after that is stated giving you the notifications for same kind of questions which is very weird.,negative

It‚Äôs very irritating while scrolling. The contents open again & again. Please add double click to get into the description.,negative
"Too Slow response of the app. Even after Updating It takes so much time to open the topic / stories after clicking. To open a picture in the page ( which are normally poor in quality) it takes so long time.Dear team QUORA, please do something to make it more responsive. Edit- Reduced 1 star, coz there is no improvement in the App.",negative
Useless when it comes to asking a question. You go to the trouble of composing the question then it wipes it clean. Utterly useless.,negative
"It took years, but they finally did give an option to close the obligatory wall installing the App. Let's hope it remains this way. So no longer one star.",neutral
"The app sends me emails to my inbox containing questions I did not ask. They really freaked me out.

A very good platform for writing and knowledge but forces to use app.And app is not ao good. Too slow loading,negative
"Terrible experience in general. Absolutely hate Quota because as I'm trying to educate myself it flips it to a different unrelated page. I do this 3 times wasting time, emotional energy, and it's very frustrating. I just want to read an article... Not sign up for some bull****. Very disappointed. If anyone has the same problem I urge you to write a similar review so they can correct this greedy, and obviously manipulative strategy. App sucks too.",negative
"I actually like Quora and its community, so you know this is a real 'one star' review. To start, Quora, if I don't want the app to access your content from my mobile device, don't force me. I will literally go anywhere else for answers before circling back to you. Why have your site pop up so high on Google if you won't let people simply read what they want and go without downloading the app? It's inconvenient, aggressive, and annoying.",positive
"This is indeed the best app ever!!!! I love to read answers from everyone and I get inspiration from them. Well, please download this I recommend this üíØ percent!!",positive
"App doesn't load at all. The ultimate issue after a looong string of other problems. I am astonished at the level of indifference Quora displays, even in the face of so many complaints and bad reviews and scathing Quora answers directed at the poor app experience. I wonder if they care at all.",negative
"Broken trash app. Ruins my phone's user experience everytime I have it running in the app switcher / while using other apps while this one is active in the background. I always have trouble typing anything in Quora while using the SwiftKey keyboard as there is crazy input lag and lot of typos coming up despite typing correctly as the keyboard is struggling to keep up with this damn app. Hence, phone overheats and my battery depletes rapidly. Get your s*** together, little brained devs in Quora.",negative
The Quora app is just too slow. Takes ages to load a single page. The app developers can do better. Really.,negative
Your website is awful. Stop trying to show me stuff and just let me read what I happen upon when searching subjects on the internet. Downloaded this app just to rate it 1 star because your website bothers me that much.,negative
"I just wanted to see an article on quora but it forced me to either install the app or continue with the browser thru logging in with google, what i stupidly even did, but instead of getting to read the article i was forced to choose topics of articles i would want to see, which i obviously could'nt skip. Just because i wanted to read a goddamn article. That got me this mad that i downloaded this app just to leave this review and give you 1*. I hope you are happy now, dear developers :)",negative
"Been on it for years. An interesting platform for exchanging ideas. Be ready to interact with people with ideas that are strange or even offensive to you. Than there is their moderation bot, removes the intelligence from AI. it would wipe your comments like an illiterate news editor.",positive
This app is pathetically slow even on high internet speed. We cannot read content through their web app. It will ask to install the mobile app and mobile app doesn't open üôÑ,negative
"What happened just now is an example of the only problem I have with the app. I would be half way into something interesting, then the text shifts, either up or down, and I would have to look for my place, or paragraph. Or it would just cancel what I'm into, and boom, I'm back at the beginning again. I used to handle it with coolness, like it was nothing that a sane, sober person would get upset about. Well, evidently there is a limit at a certain number of repeats. Ain't my kind of life.",negative

Disgusting app. Every thime it causes crash when I open the app. Takes more time to load contents. Quora should Update and fix the problems.,negative
Platform has been hijacked by extreme political ideologies and marketing strategies. Could have been great.,negative
Web version put the compulsion to download app .which is absurd thing app is worst but great work of writers is appreciable. Please remove yourself from search engine that will be great,negative
"Quora is good platform , but app was very bad . Bad user experience because off lag , when switching to other pages it takes huge time .",negative
"I can't believe that this app is not as popular as facebook and twitter, it shows how humans prioritize things. If you want to learn something new you are in the right place.",negative
"I like Quora itself, but this app is laughably bad. Half the time, I can't show the full answer to questions. There are so many bugs that have existed for years. I cannot believe that a large platform could make an app this low quality and never improve it. It's just disappointing and actively pushes me away from using Quora.",negative
"Pathetic app managementüôè A wonderful concept, and it use to be my favorite app earlier but whence I search anything on Google about any knowledge or opinion, it suggests quora as 1 of the firsts, & it directs you to the app but even after installing it,it doesn't let you read it because of update which they don't offer or let us do... So we are stuck at that",negative

"I have been happily using Quora since years, no complains till now, but recently I have no idea whats going on as links take considerably more time to open despite fast internet connectivity, also notifications are just stuck. I humbly urge Quora team, please get this controlled before any dire consequences, once drawn people are leaving. Thank you.",negative
"Its amazing but could u improve the speed of the application, its slow and takes lot of time to load even if the user has enough resources",negative
Just want to read articles online but it Forces you to read articles in their app. Annoying forces you to update too.,negative
The app is making my day worse. Loading a content takes too much time. There have been no major updates in themes or other options apps like reddit provide. I cannot personally save my answer. Notifications are not regular. I can only choose one pic at a time . For each every pic I have to go find it . This is just very frustrating. My replies to a comment often goes nowhere. They are nowhere to be found. If I view it later the comment is present but my reply is not. I cannot download pictures,negative
if I want to download the app I will download the app I do not want to be forced or redirected to download your app unless I choose to thank you very much for your time. take note there are a lot better ways of getting people to download your app. And be honest it's about money not an easier user experience. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£,neutral
The app experience is super. I like It very much. And the theme is very simple and easy to use. I love the app because I loved to use it daily for my all daily life. If I had any doubt I will browse on Quora. It will give best answers and relevent answer and you can also ask questions also and you can get answers. It is like a game. You can answer or you can ask.,positive
To read something... we have to create account. Once created lot of mails in inbox. Do you think i see my mail and then come to quora. Stupid enforcements. Just started to avoid this site while browsing.,negative
Very nice app for writers who want to show their talent must download . You can clear your every single doubt and also can clear others doubt also . You can express yourself with your knowledge. Highly recommended for those who are willing to be a writer in future. :-),positive

I haven't put my television set on for quite a while all because of how much I enjoy Quora and the so many different topics that you just can't get enough of but you also cannot seem to set your phone down to do anything else that doesn't include Quora! Highly recommend",positive
I would have given 5 stars but the only problem is that whenever we find something interesting in quora in browser it forces us to either login or install the app which is quite frustrating. Apart from this the app is very useful and i just love it!,negative
"I hope you do an update where we can organize our bookmarked answers into folders or at least put in a search option. I've been using Quora for a long time so I naturally have lots of bookmarks. Just now I was thinking back to an answer I read idk how many months or years ago but I was meaning to re-read and cite it, & navigating the bookmarks has been a pain-in-the-ass‚Äîit doesn't even have a search bar! It's an inconvenience, really, and undermines the purpose of the bookmarks section.",neutral
"The app is so bad I can't see full answer all the time. Disappointing, since I love the platform and regularly visit the web when I'm on my laptop.",negative
Poor app Don't allow you to send destination links to answers and also app runs very slow,negative
Earlier it was fast and prompt but now a days page takes lot of time to open around 2 3 minutes for a single page opening . From notification it take more time too...,negative
It doesn't load in time and freezes most times. Very bad app.,negative
I used it n it was gud.....n after updating it's closing automatically n refreshing automatically n I can't use it properly nw so plzzz fix this problem...,negative
It takes ages to run or open. Absolutely just too slow and heavy. Why is it forcing me to update? And do I have to wait till eternity before it does the update?,negative
"3. Can you make your app notch friendly, it been a long time since the notches are introduced, But in my OnePlus Nord, it's not playing well. look into this. 2. Thanks for adding night mode. 1.Where is night mode and Reading Mode ????",negative
"I love the whole idea of the app, and it's pretty useful for people who know where they should spend their time on Quora, but the mobile app is a troublemaker for me. The app becomes super slow and laggy after using it for 15-30 mins. My phone heats up as if I have been playing Fortnite on my phone and streaming it on another app at the same time. If the app continues to heat up my phone, I will spend a lot less time on the app. Hope this heating problem can be fixed.",positive
I'll give it five stars but because of a small issue that it doesn't store much of the cache so we can use it even we don't have the availability of internet....but it doesn't work for a moment without the availability of internet even doesn't open the home page........hope you'll fix the issue!,negative
After reading critical comments I thought every app has such users but I was wrong it's really slow and full of bug. You well be irritated by its way of showing answers,negative
"Im a quora user, not new ive been using this app for past 8-10 yrs as I remember... But the new update stinks, question search takes time more and IE browser. Space follow request takes years. Daily post refresh is even worse all i get is flashing screen(ur loading UI). PLEASE FIX THESE BUGS AND LAGS",negative
I'm happy about Quora app where I can gain some knowledge and improve reading habit. But the app is not working properly in uploading new articles and it takes too much time to load hence pls do the corrective action,neutral
The online version is better. Great place to get answers about pooping and peeing. But this APP SUCKS! STUFF WON'T LOAD!,negative
Great platform for knowledge sharing 1 star for force update Worst thing application won't work without installing new update Also with new update it become slower day by day,negative
"Thiss app is very usefull and informative... Only one thing need to be updated is that sometimes it takes alot of time to load, just alotüôÑ",neutral
"First you force us to install the app, Then we search something on browser, and a quora link appears in search result, when we click on the link, quora app opens with its bloody homepage, and the link i clicked on never opens, neither in browser, nor in the app. So its like quora will give us all info, EXCEPT the one we search for.",negative
It's a pretty good application where an answer for every question can be gotten. There are so many caveats First of all there is no dark mode you can't make the background dark and the don't white. You can't zoom through the answers,positive
About to write the same feedback of the user : Green Flash at sunset. The purpose of bookmarks is to re use them. So add search bar & organising or saving bookmarks into multiple folders just like laptop Chrome browser. This is such a primary feature & i didn't understand how quora missed for these long years. Please share the feedback to dev team. Thank you!,neutral
I enjoy engaging with people from all corners of the world and all walks of life. The one issue I have with the system is that on occasions the question posted appears to change once I click on it to offer an answer. This would appear to be a technical linking issue or maybe the original poster of the question somehow changed the question and the amendments did not transpose to the online offering.,neutral
What's the purpose of an app which doesn't load correctly? Its junk. You rather use the website it will load much faster.,negative
"I LOVE this app! I've become a contributor on one space, and got invited to have my own space as well... And, the best part is: No one putting you down, trolls don't tend to go here, and there's a TON of highly intelligent people on here that will try to answer your questions the best they can! üòÑ",positive
It is a very good application but its drawback is that the app has to be forcibly installed. And daily updates too.,negative
"I have a advice for you quora, no matter how hard you to always signin in google chrome may people will download your but I promise whenever they will have question they will only go on google so if you want to make the user use your app, add a feature in which no matter normal or incognito tab the user will be directly transferred to the app and will use the app further, dont irritate us by always wasting our time on signing in everytime we click the 2nd question. Please look after this.",neutral
It has to be one of the most informal apps ever. just everything and anything you ever wanted to know and more! Adicting! The description does not even begin to describe what this app is all about.... Enjoy but be careful what you wish for! MICK..,positive
Network and Loading issues.. Connecting issues.. Slow functioning.. Late response.. Content is good but app experience is not.. REQUIRED UPDATE for fixing many bugs and fast interface after response for viewing..,negative
"Trash app... Too many insincere questioners, asking the same redundant questuions. Not a safe app, I started receiving spam emails from overseas because of Quora. Most people overseas using quora either have nothing to do or are trying to steal personal information through phishing. Plus the app is slow after 15-20 minutes.",negative
So so many topics too choose from. I like this app because the comments written are not only just from one professional or one organization alone. The comments also come from everyday people's personal experiences as well. This really helped me alot when coming to terms with the fact that I had been in a Narscistic relationship and also gives you lots of ideas on how to deal with it. Of course the app covers many many other topics and all the information is FREE! One of my favorite apps!,positive
"Very thorough! Not a topic too far reaching, everything covered, consumer created so consumer standards met. No censorship from what I can see. Winning app!",positive
Very slow and poor experience... A Good idea and good app with poor performance... I'm going to uninstall it untill I listen something new and fast on it.,negative
Giant heaping mess of text. Very poorly designed app and makes it very difficult to understand the flow of info. Tip: Hire a good UI guy.,negative
After the recent update - 1. I am not able to upvote any answer. 2. Not able to comment. 3. The answer is taking lot of time to load. Lots of bugs i guess...kindly fix,negative
The app got hanged easily and very slow in Android but the Platform is informative.. Why the app is super slow and I can't read other answers to any question? They seems like always loading but never appear before my eyes.,negative
Unable to unsubscribe notifications from Quora at my Gmail that fill my Google account space forcing me to buy space. Please fix this error I want to unsubscribe notifications from Quora at my Gmail account.,negative
"The app is currently very very laggy, There have been no updates to the app in a while and no one in the company even acknowledges there is a problem the certainly isn't just happening to me. I've seen multiple questions on quora and Reddit noting this problem.",negative
"It is my most favorite app. From here we can share our knowledge with others and can gain new ones. It increases our curiosity and rise our interest to any subject. We can read daily updates of science or a subject here. You should install it. It helps you in study and homework. Knowledge should not be limited. So, gain knowledge as much as you can. It costs nothing.",positive
"Of course I should give 5 stars for quora!! Becoz OMG how much helpful is these quora...we'll get all our answers in this quora and it is really very interesting to read. If i open quora,I will be going on reading literally for 2 to 3 hoursüòÖ.AT LAST THIS IS BEST APP EVER!!‚ô•Ô∏è",positive
"I request the devs to provide an option of dark theme. It will be a blessing to all readers who uses the app at night in the dark for long hours. All other apps which provide services like articles, blogs, magazine provide dark theme option. Quora being a mainly text focused app ought to have this functionality. Edit: Changing the rating to 5 stars since the dark mode has been added.",positive
"There is always something interesting to read with this app. Sometimes I find myself reading, reading and more reading when in this app. Usually a couple hours go by and don't even realize it. Thumbs up with this app",positive
"I still don't remember how I came across this website/ app, But I absolutely love it! I've become a semi celebrity on here. I also enjoy the answers I get from some other questions that I ask. I'm able to ask people that work with the subjects that I am asking about",positive
This app is excellent. But app loading time is slow. I hope next time developers fix this issue.,negative
App is not even working .......so worst as the app is not working then what is the use........ Improve the updates and even the buttons are not working.........i have a great opinion on Quora and i dont want to remove it. :( [üò§üò†üò°],negative
"The community and the concept is great, there's a dark mode now, and it's not as laggy anymore. I absolutely love the new Quora.",positive
Very good app with some great options. But please add the images and videos download option from the answers. My problem is still not solved,positive
Set up is way too much I just want to read some articles not input endless amounts of data.,negative
"It is a very informative App especially to layman One can not be master of all subjects. To a Jack who has not studied a specific subject this App is a source of sharing knowledge ,experience, friendship and brotherhood.",positive
"It's a very very good platform for getting knowledge, but app needs some work.",positive
"Its a good website I can find what I want on Google it always gives me the right question im asking but on the app it's way different I can't even find anything useful for me the search is so dumb it just gives me different questions, I always use the website bc its better and easier to use fix this problem please as soon as possible",negative
It's too slow just to load questions and everything but it's a good platform to discuss. I hope it improves,positive
A good place to get knowledge from peoples experience. UPDATE: Can you provide an option to rotate to landscape for tablets.,positive
"It is an excellent platform. Allows readers to both gather and express knowledge on almost any area known to man. (Politics and Romance related topics do draw a large crowd to them) Especially different perspectives, anecdotal experiences and sometimes great advice and information shared can be extremely insightful. It is also a great platform for debating and discussing with those having an opposite viewpoint. Allows anyone to write a good answer and reach thousands. Only - is unfair moderation",positive
As they said get your answer.. it's absolutely right....i every time when i am on worse situation when i need my answer of my puzzle questions it's always helps me...I love the apps..so i give it 5 star. Very helpful who are try to find there answer by ownself. Thank to making a digital plaform to ask and got answer.,positive
"App is not at all working properly and it suddenly jumps of the screen, it need more improvement",negative
Very good app great place for learning and general knowledge. The information however isn't 100% reliable so its best to check 2-3 answers before making up your mind.,positive
"Lots of places you can ask questions. Some darn funny, others quite serious, but you can get honest feedback or have some fun with silly things. Highly Recommend!",positive
This app is very slow and freezes at all times. Have downloaded the app but even opening it is a problem because it freezes,negative
I can see how this app could help someone who is struggling with a wide range of very difficult issues. Even the good things in life need to be shared also.,positive
To write a question it takes 1hr to complete....No no no.. I have preety fast typing speed let me confirm that.. My phone also runs smoothly. So who is responsible for that? obiously me.! I Decided to run this app. Quora please SELL YOURSELF TO FACEBOOK. I know its going hard for you. please Take a coffic and enjoy the rest of the day like you always do and let the job do by facebook devolopers. Thanks,negative
Content loading takes hell lot of time and data. It's 2020 you guys still using webview ? Honestly didn't expect this kind of app from Quora. Sucks. Uninstalling. I will stick with Web.,negative
Hands down the best app on my phone. (sorry YouTube) But the 1 Flaw that stops this app from being the best of all time is the fact that you cant have different folder for certain bookmarks and I hate how if you wanted to see the very first thing you bookmarked you have to keep on scrolling for days.,positive
"Nice app, entertaining answers, but I deleted because I kept being taken to topics that I had accidentally clicked on once and never wanted to see again.",negative
"Really bad app, being forced on you by Quora and Google. Way worse browsing experience than the web version, but the web version forces you to install it. Then there's Google ranking Quora on the first page for almost any search query.",negative
Can be good for simple questions but NEVER ask for advice about anything that there could be any sort of argument with. Very biased app.,negative
"The app is very much slow in Android 9, and loading content takes too much time.",negative
"Informative app where we can Exchange views with people of different countries. But disables every 3rd Answer, hangs alot",negative
"Best life tips, best for self development, Just a minor improvement needed is that there is no option for zoom in in this app, its hard for those whose eyesight is weak.",positive
Quora is fun on desktop but when it comes to Android I don't know what developers think. Please it's a request to make the app a bit smoother and should take less time to load posts. Having a 8 gb ram makes no sense to this app.,negative
"I like Qoura too much, when I want some questions' answer I do Quora and got that, when I've some topic I wrote on Quora ( but didn't give answer anyone of my question because I haven't somemore followers, LOL). But it has so much issues in this app (Quora) First of all page loading is very slowly whether how fast your internet is but it load slowly. Second when you wanna write something like question or else answer, that time section is immensely lagging. :(",negative
"Will be nice to have 'Read more' link in the same row as the other buttons like share, etc. 'Read more' above the share icon is sometimes inconvenient..",neutral
Knowledgeable...great application to spend time and learning lots of things....its a dynamic platform to learn and make yourself up to date. Best update is Night mode in quora very helpful and beneficial... Love you Quora üíûüòâüòò,positive
There should be a separate tab for spaces which we are following..it is very difficult to find them by serching again..and majority of our Home should be filled with the quetions from the spaces which we are following..,neutral
"Recently even with updating the app, I am unable to see the comments of the people under an article or an answer. It is really frustrating please do something and please reply.",negative
"The Quora questions answer links on chrome open the app but its own ques and answers that I'm not interested in, meaning; the quora ques I clicked in the browser isn't the one that is shown when it launches the app.",negative
Please fix your app. It crashes very frequently. It used to happen before also and now also. The app is really nice but because of the crashing I dont really like it,negative
Worst User Interface. Takes too much time. Loads too much. Just work on UI & smoothness. Else everything is perfect. Will update (edit) my ratings if UI is improved.,negative
"The developers of this app are worst and the moderators are too strict. Always server problem, loading problem, from 2 years. I don't know why such an famous site has poor developers.",negative
"Too many random notifications! The web site pretty much forces you to have the app, so if you occasionally want to use the service, you're just consistently being bombarded with random nonsense.",negative
"It works sometimes, but it's really slow for the Android app. I agree with a previous review. Could you fix this? I might end up installing another forum app.",negative
"Bad user experience. The content is good and UI is really simple and usefull, but the loading times when I try to open new pages really awfully bad. Not just on Android apps, also in Website too. Sucks.",negative
"Terrible load times, constant crashing or mandatory updates. The fact that a website with zero real content aside from text requires me to download an app is already befuddling, but the blatant disregard for quality control and user experience compounds this further.",negative
"It is an extremely liberally oriented site. Many questions are formulated to fitment argument. If you are right, or even slightly right of center, politically, it may well frustrate you beyond comprehension. Trust me. There is not much debate as derision, and the moderators are like little dictatorships. They deem what's offensive if it doesn't fit their narrative. Never tell you why. Just delete it saying it doesn't meet standards. I gave it two stars solely because it exists.",negative
"I am not able to upload the photos in my answers.whrn I click on the photos options,it opens gallery but when I click on the photos it never get uploaded.It has been more than 30 days please tell me if I have mistaken or it is the genuine fault.damn frustrating",negative
This app is actually taking so much time to load. I actually recommend people not to use this app. It's getting black continuously.. I really help this app..,negative
Not working on my Android phone. You just keep tapping on the answers & nothing happens.,negative
"The app has lost its charm. It's quite messed up, takes too much time to load the content.",negative
"Any time, any doubts, we will get clarified & it's really helpful. Today everything is against money. But here it's free service. This platform gives boost to learn a lot. Thank you for your services.",positive
"Why it is forcing to download the app to view more questions. I want to browse in internet browser. No night mode, no history. Stupid outdated app. Update- Still 1 star for this outdated app",negative
"It is a good app. I like it. But it does work very slowly.so,it‚Äôs need an update that's it do any work firstly. And who use this app he get a profile from Quora.",positive
I think its a good platform to learn about stuff. People are giving it 1 star because it lags? Bruh get a new phone or sum. Personally very nice,positive
Sometimes server is complete down both on app and website. But other sites are working.,neutral
It's good App to me. I learnt alot. But now now it has changed into Arabic and I don't understand Arabic. That's why I have uninstall.,negative
Nos of time I face a problem that photographs from gallery cann't upload. photographs selected but not upload when I use final option Post. Twi times problem automatically solved but again & again I face same issues.,negative
I am facing lots of problem in this application. When I try to upload pictures in my content this takes huge time to load that image.,negative
It's very good. people share there idea here. But quara app for Android is very slow. It have not any spilt view even,positive
App is useful but its very heavy in loading. Make it lightweight to access information. I have edited this review to get attention.,neutral
New update sucks. Doesn't load anything. Every time error in connection,negative
This app is becoming absolutely bogus day by day. The time it takes to load and navigate to any new screen is greater than that of your crush's reply.,negative
look quora this app bugs alot when i try to look at questions and the fact that i have to use my real ful name on my acount & i get blocked cuz i used my most known name that i am more conforible with i cant use my none real ful name is sus & a violation to my privacy & my identity & when i try to write about the errors by taping on the notification it says try again & it never works when i try to send a complaint about the situation with my acount ima need you to fix that & the bugs & ERRORS,negative
"Useless app, doesn't open. I keep starng at a white screen whenever I try to use it. Am going to uninstall it!",negative
"I log in once, and since then QUORA send me unasked emails about random topics. It's just like a virus. I recommend to avoid this.",negative
"You guys don't delete accounts that harrass, plagiarize, and steal idenities, but you deleted my friend's account for being 12, when he's 22 and has posted photos for proof. Mods suck and I dislike the messaging format. I can't see if the other person has sent a message because the box takes up my whole screen. Another issue I had was that my long answers crash. Other that that, it's decent.",negative
"Your idea is good, but your app is not user friendly, uploading a picture takes too much time and it updated version it is even more difficult.",negative
I had to delete the app due to constant pushes to enable notifications. I still receive email from Quora but will probably block those. They are almost unreadable for the same reason. Reminds me of a relentless car salesman. I never buy from one who pushes too hard.,negative
The app is very unresponsive... the information sharing idea deserves more than 5 stars... but app is really bad. I prefer visiting website rather than using app.,negative
Great app!! But the only downside about this app is that it takes so much time to load which is very annoying. Please we hope soon that something be done about this like probably making a lite version,negative
The site just constantly tells me to try the app but the app is so slow and unresponsive and a chore to use. I'd rather use the site.,negative
I love Quora. It is very interesting and informative. There does seem to be some censorship and I'm not really sure where that comes from. But certain opinions and information will disappear. And there are plenty of trolls. But all in all a very enjoyable site and I usually read it every day.,positive
"This app is super, it will help you to become a master from zero. I didn't know how to face the interview of St. Stephen's College but through quora I find out what were questions asked in previous years and finally I got into the college. Thank you Quara",positive
This app really good....but one kind request....please improve the app speed...because it taking more time for loading stories and notifications also not coming regularly....,positive
Why do I need the app to read answers for more than one question? I got the app anyway and log in. I then tap on the weekly digest section and it takes me to log-in screen - I log in - Tap on weekly digest - Log-in screen - repeat. It was as annoying as it sounds. I'd give 1 star for the forced installation. Plus 1 star for the dark mode.,negative
Just another complicated aggravation in life I don't need. I don't understand why it seems impossible to create an app super easy to use. It's as though they think thats all we want to do is navigate through a bunch of BS!,negative
"I have learnt a lot from the platform, and the app makes it easier to access quality information and advice.",positive
"Worst application after the update. I see a lot of unnecessary boxes and tabs which I don't need. User experience is worst. I cannot quickly find the ""ask a question"" option in the app itself. I don't understand why do company hire useless team to make changes in the application.",negative
"Sorry for my initial comment, I guess that happened cos I have just opened the app for the first time. Nevertheless, always show the clicked post first and prompt the user later to follow his interests.",neutral
"I like this site for giving and getting questions asked/answered. However, I notice few women are published or accepted for writing a post, in lieu of a man w less interest ing content..",neutral
"Quality of answers is getting lower and lower. It wasn't like before, too many spaces, irrelevant posts in the space, Which Seems like advertising. Very sad to see all that.",negative
"Earlier I was bit happy and excited when I used to open this app, but after latest update it's experience has slow down, it takes time to load the feed, after clicked on one answer it even takes more time to load, because of time loading issue it's quite irritating. Please Developer look in to this issue.",negative
"I like the concept and the answers are quality in my experience, but I can't stand their UX decisions. I don't want to have to install the app to visit the website, and I especially don't want to get, with out fail, a notification a day or so later for EVERY question I click on, asking if I want to know more about that question. I don't. I already found my answer or I've moved on. I've searched profile, app, and system settings for a way to disable these notifications. It's all or nothing.",negative
Superb app!.. it is a really good app as it always clears my doubts about anything and helps me to know others prospective as well regarding a particular query... So yaa good work by the developers...it is quite nostalgic as well to be honest ü§£...,positive
It takes so much time to load the content . But it satisfies me . I like to read life experiences and facts in this app . They are the most entertaining and ads are needed to be reduced. Thank you for reading .,positive
"I don't trust content on quora anymore. The verification process is not like before, it seems extremely biased now. Instead of Professors and industry experts, now everyone makes posts and replies, it seems more like the YouTube comment section or Twitter.",negative
This app is useless on my galaxy s9. Clicking any quora link in the browser opens the app and automatically redirects me to a home page instead of the subject of the link I was following. This wouldn't be much of an issue if the search functioned better but once I lose a specific answer I have found there I a good chance I won't ever find it again,negative
"Really slow (three clicks from the push notification to actually reading an article, with loading times between each click), crashes randomly, and NO BROWSING HISTORY (good luck finding a specific article once you navigate away from it). But the content itself is good.",negative
The content in the app is very good.. five star rating is also not enough.. but the only drawback I found is load time of app is very slow,positive
"Slow, unoptimized, buggy. If I click a Quora link on Chrome, it opens Quora but the homepage and not the specific link Loading time is massive: my internet is just fine, everything else loads just fine.",negative
"I don't have so many interest. I force me to select 9 topics. I can't use the app at all. Uninstall within 5 mins. Worst terms g conditions. How can you try to force users to select more ""interest"" topic where the user not interested?",negative
Terrible. App is so slow to load and 'annoyingly niggly'. I don't understand why you need to make an app when you can use the web? It's much faster especially with my WiFi connected. Yes they want to make money from ads. But for that they drive you mad with downloading the app and a trillion notifications,negative
I don't know anything about the questions this asked me at all.... I just like the layout and content. It's more of an information and help type app than Facebook is with the drama and bs.,neutral
I am reducing already given stars from 5 to 2 as I have been using quora for 3 years and aware a lot about it. Earlier system on quora was good but due to partner programs quality content and knowledge expressing is reducing now. People ask stupid questions consist only photos which have nothing to do with writing or answer for knowledge sake. Its quality is degrading and now turning into another poor content area just like other platforms. Improve early otherwise it may cost expensive.,negative

This application is very informative and here I get to learn something new everyday and this is the reason why I am active on quora everyday for more than 5 hours.,positive
"The reading experience on the mobile app is decent. But the writing experience on quora is horrible. Please improve the writing experience on the mobile app. A 5 minute answer can took 20 min to write. You will need a laptop to write an answer on quora. Lastly, There are complaints of fake mass reporting and answer collapsing so Quora should review it's policy and should give more options to save your bookmarks.",negative
"Awesome app and very helpful, we can discuss our doubts and solve it easily!...This app is also a source of knowledge.Greatüëå",positive
"No dark mode even in 2021 & the app is 99% white, great job dev(s). Also why is Quora forcing me to use this app while browsing the website via phone ? Quora website works BETTER in my browser plus can take advantage of my browser's dark mode. Make a better app like Reddit or stop forcing us to install this app.",negative
This application is very bad. Crushing every time and it is consuming more power. Don't Download it my friend,negative
"Not the best app in the world, but the questions & answers are entertaining to read sometimes. I basically just use use it for that: entertainment. However I do like the LGBTQ+ spaces on there. They've made me feel less confused on a few things. Only reason i'm giving this app 4 stars. Otherwise i'd give it 3 but yeah, it's good for entertainment & queer people like me (asexual lesbian btw.)",positive
"Reduced ratings from 3 stars to 1 star. What are the requirements of Quora to open this app? I have Android 9.0, 4GB RAM, 23 GB free ROM but still quora takes 2 to 3 minutes to fully open and display content on screen. Sometimes nothing appears except Profile photo beside HOME title. Very poor app and overloaded interface. It looks like app developed by some kids from WhiteHat Jr. who are still struggling to make app run smoothly and open within couple of minutes.",negative
"I'm giving it one star because of how ostentatious and polrumptious a lot of the people are. I defended myself whilst being attacked, but rather than block the abusive user, Quora found it necessary to delete my posts, and block me from doing anything. I tried to rebuttal the actions as I had never used an expletive, or posted an answer that was remotely inappropriate. Yet, Quora still find the time to send me notifications that I cannot interact with. Block me, but send me notifications.",negative
"Quite slow, even if there is a good network, it takes too much time to open, its irritating!",negative
"Using Quora since 6 years. Loved it initially with informative answers and great questions. But now, it has become more political and there are trolls who report agressively. Guys, please bring back the former glory of the app. Can't stand to watch a brilliant app go down. The UI has gone down and ads, please remove the ad experience. It's killing us.",negative
"If you make the mistake of getting this app you can never take it off of your phone. You can disable it, but it won't go away. You have to factory reset you phone in order to delete this dreadful app.",negative
The best apk to find a solution to mental and physical problems. But this apk will be better if it's performance and stability is improved.,positive

"Quora deserves a more respectful app. This one is so heavy, so slow that I feel discouraged to keep browsing after a few minutes...",negative

Its very bad app It is a religious app Its antihindu. Its don't block the profile even if we report it for 500 times. It allows muslim to say bad words to hindu but dont allow hindu to do the same with muslims.,negative
It usually has some interesting stuff to read but half of the articles are garbage from fake accounts and some are missleading or untrue.,negative
"This app is terrible, the from page is filled with gore, pictures of dead carcasses, and victims of violent attacks. I can't go two posts without seeing one of these, and even worse, they aren't even censored. And this also has nothing to do with my preferences, as I've only looked at academic threads.",negative
This app is so helpful for meüòä .i am neet aspirant and I use this app for knowing the study planning and motivation. Also in break time i like to read the routine of medical students.,positive

"The latest update has disabled posting any answer to any question from the Android platform. Thus one is now limited to posting in a space, or reading others' answers. Thus the app has become useless.",negative
Its okay. I must say it's VERY informative. But it's becoming to much like a bickering match between people's differences of opinion. Too much drama,neutral
Questions and Answers are ver helpful and entertaining. But.... Fix the lag issue . And it takes too much time to load!! Testing my patience,negative
Why is it extremely slow? It's getting useless day by day. Whats the point of app when the app is slower than the website? Im specifically talking about the delay of getting to app from chrome. Its not because of slower phone because other apps run blazing fast.,negative
"Useless app , shows one post at a time wehn reading have to go back for another post instead of showing other just below it like website",negative

"The app is terrible. It freezes frequently, editing is absolutely un user friendly and terrible. Update after update and the most basic things are still bad. It still freezes and hangs up a lot, not to mention, the moderation is piss poor. You get flagged for the most unnecessary things, and people who comment even worse things than you, are somehow exempted.",negative
I just hate this . *uck quora. What a non sense type of app is this . All are build up people on quora bragging about themselves. And mostly it is like another Instagram.(so many pics). It always collapses all my answers. I never get the answers for question i asked.No one replies to my messages. It literally wastes all my time in scrolling. Some times the content is so boring and irrelevant. There are also bugs. Also there is non sense . I promise i will not open this app this year.....!!!,negative
To d man who developed this app let me just tell that the idea is great but it's d app is so slow when it comes to responding while im using the app on my phone but on the website there is actually no problem loading things,positive
Cheap content containing more nudity than real Information..very slow .. fails to load pages despite having good bandwidth,negative

"1 star is being generous. Worst designed and ran app I've come across. Looks outdated, full of bugs and slow as a snail- nothing to do with my device (plenty reviews also saying it's slow.) Why is half the screen plain white? Load of rubbish. Would use the website but that's just as bad. Come on, it's 2021. Thought a company as big as that could make a good looking decent app.",negative

"I had this app installed for a long time. Today I uninstalled it and then try to install it again... But it's been over 10 hrs and it just says ""pending""...",negative
"Very poor execution of a very good concept. I love the idea of the app that helps us share our stories, ideas and knowledge with like-minded people but at the same time the kind of responsiveness and lag free experience that one would expect from an app in 2021 is nonexistent. Hope the developers improve the current situation of the app. I will edit my review if I see any visible improvementsüòÄüòç.",negative

"I love Quora. I practically live on it honestly. But the app needs some work. It randomly either freezes up, slows way down or is otherwise unresponsive like trying to tap on a specific notification but it won't do anything until I tap on a different notification. I don't know if this because of my phone or not.",negative
Actually it made my day when i had downloaded it And come to the point why i have given 3 star why not 5. Off course it helped me lot in reading since my reading skill is weak so to strong it i started reading but most of the people are active on this app don't write much knowledgeable thing so i conclusively use it for amusement,positive

"I just had this idea don't know whether it was worth it or not but u guys can update this app for instead of pasting others questions let them ask question according to the there standard and answer acc. to there standard But at the end ans should be correct for ex- boy 5 yr old math question ( 2+3 ) , given by anyone who is online, but the correct ans will be highlighted or your guy could provide corrects ans with facts and fun to learn , I think much can be improve but limit is 500",neutral

I am using this app for last 4 years and updated this app regularly in the hope that it will get better but no luck. This app is full of bugs and errors.,negative
Thanks for adding dark mode. But dark theme needs to be optimised more and you should work more on server as it sometimes take more than normal to load. You need to update personalisation algorithm and should offer better personalized content. Edit: Filled with ads and they send non-personalised notification and recommendations. I deleted my account.,neutral
"App was quite fluent at the beginning but now, it has lot of mess and notorious elements which keep on threatening questioners and not sure if it's bug or something but pages keep on loading without actually shooting anything ever after 10 Minutes wait. App was informative earlier but it's just like waste of time.",negative
"App not working. If I click on any contents, the message coming please check your internet.",negative
"The app flags your answer as innapropriate even for the most smallest things, on top of that this app isn't mobile friendly. Quora honestly needs a lot of improvement.",negative
Content is good. But app is super slow. Profile picture uploads but rotation is wrong,negative
1. It lacks state persisting hence I cannot continue reading when the app becomes active after a longer idle period. A kind of cursor mechanism would be cool so the reader could continue reading from he/she has left off. 2. In general REST responses could be faster. Often I wait fairly long for a short answer - 1000 characters - to be downloaded. 3. As for the community there are a tremendous amount of cool people hang around here.,neutral
It's too slow compared to other application like facebook. Always in loading state. Moreover i try to use dark theme but there is no change.,negative

Everything is being laid down, clearly presented and can vividly relate to some of the insights posted by various contributors from all walks of life.

Quora service is very good. But the app has some issues. We can't upload photos with questions and the app take too much time to load.,negative

"I was ""coerced"" into ""joining"" Quora, 2 years ago; I simply needed an answer to a question I had asked.(""Google"") I wrote 1,000 answers to others' questions; ALWAYS showing respect and honor for the questioner. I EXPOSED certain ""Authorities"" and ""Officials"", on the site(and in the world) for the LIES and misleading information that they were writing and spreading. I GOT ""BANNED""!!! THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR: honest, factual answers; written with respect, for the BEST-INTERESTS of others!",neutral

"very helpful. i've had my account for a good 8 months or so, but i decided to delete it recently. for some reason, i'm not allowed to ask questions nor answer. absolutely ridiculous, as it is the reason i decided to make an account in the first place. for this, i'm putting this app on a solid two stars. whenever i decide to make a new account, and i'm able to successfully answer other's questions, i will higher the rating of this.",negative

I love to read about others and places and pretty much how everyone in the world views life and all it has to offer. I love the feed back.,positive
"Asking questions have really come a long way. Three features that i really like is that 1 you're suggested with probably similar questions, 2.asking relevant people and 3.categorizing the question. Would really love to give it 5 stars, however answers from people seem to be messed up, I wish the UX can feel like the question and answers can be displayed in a singular, limear thread/page",positive

Locked in portrait mode no matter how your device is configured or oriented. This is a frustrating user interface flaw,negative
"Well Quora certainly has a way of seducing me... an eye catching pic here, emotionally reactive post there and im instantly committed to following the trail of information wherever it may go.

"The app lags often and the new algorithm shows a lot of irrelevant stuff instead of useful things. The quality of the content on the site has degraded over the years and the algorithm will often bombard you with a popular Quoran's posts just because you checked a couple of their posts, even if you do not follow them. Many questions are insincere and many answers are highly biased. It is no longer the platform for knowledge that it used to be.",negative

"Whenever i need information app gets disconnected from network, while network is working properly. fix this out otherwise i have to uninstall this app",negative
"""Something went wrong"" this error shows up everytime I try to click Quora link from Google Search app, this just happen recently, it was working fine before. My internet is fine, so what ""went wrong"" actually?",negative
Used to work well until it started crashing frequently. The app is clearly broken. Nothing loads despite having a good network connection. Needs a major fix. 2 stars for now.,negative
"I have been using quora since 2017 , it was a good app . But now it's not working most of the times , showing ""No internet connection "" even if I have good connection and all other apps are working fine . I request the developers to fix the bug as soon as possible and that made me give a one star üåü rating .",negative
i love the contents in the app but the app itself is devastating even with very high speed connection it shows no connection and even sometime not even load I also get hang even in my phone i.e. note 20ultra,negative
"It used to be my favorite app, but now it has turned garbage. The content on home is worst than ever. The navigation is so poor and most of the viewable content seems like spam. The older app was much, much better.",negative
Hard to navigate. Clicking more on comments reloads the page and takes you back up to the top. This is extremely frustrating adding lots of additional unnecessary scrolling. Each time you are sent back to the top you have to scroll past the comments you've already read. I've uninstalled and will keep down voting quora suggestions in Google so I see less of their content.,negative
"I learnt a lot from Quora and i was very active on Quora. I even had written 1200+ answers and i loved it. But one day, i wanted to delete 2 questions from my profile but their policy didn't allow it. I think not allowing users their question is fine but they should at least allow making it anonymous or at least removing it from their profile. So I ultimately had to delete my profile",positive
I literally downloaded this app just to leave a review saying don't use this app or the website. If you have even the remotest conservative thought they'll flag your comment or answer. They are completely biased and not worth using.,negative
"An amazing app. Very accurate to the description/title, and seeing other peoples questions, and the answers they get can be quite comforting",positive
"Well its a great app app, until now it has showing me no i ternet xonnection even though I am connected to an internet connection, I even tried this with an wifi but it doesnt work. Plz fix this",negative
"I am relieve after seeing I am not the only one who have ""no connection"" problem. It really is something wrong with app and not my phone. Please fix this. It is so frustating.",negative
Extremely slow to show the information after clicked on link read more from their website. It need to make a lot of improvements on this App!,negative
Giving this app 3 stars cuz since a month i am not able to add images in my answers. Please resolve this issue so i will give you 5 stars. üôèüôè Edit. Now the issue is resolved but one more arrived. Not able to suggest edits. Giving 4 stars. Solve it and I'll give you 5 stars.,negative

Keeps on showing no internet connection even when I have a good connection and all other apps work fine. The app doesn't load anything.,negative
Been trying to unsubscribe unsuccessful many times. contstant email. Completely useless app .I have had to mark it as spam . Would not reconmend it anybody .,negative
"The application is not working most of the times. It shows no internet connection, I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling even though the problem persists.",negative
Could be improved. It's be better if you could improve the interface. Personally a major improvement would be to read the complete notification by expanding it in the notification panel instead of seeing half of a question... It's just frustrating. And I don't understand why it needs access to my contacts.,negative
"This app is partially good and equally bad as well. Reason is very simple and important from my point of view.some of the question/ answers are very knowledgeable and worth learning ,but some are really bad in taste. Some people's ask dirty and obsene and sexy question. The app co. Should be cautious and edit such rubbish stuff, since every male/ female read such answers",negative
I used to love this app and still I do but with new update quora is not working properly on my phone. The problem is not in my phone but on this app. Please fix this problem team quora.,negative
"Keeps crashing on my phone to the point where it's completely unusable, please make a PWA",negative
"I have been using quora since years, since recently it started showing ""no internet connection"" even when all other apps are working fine. I have to resort to it's desktop site to browse. Please fix it, quora team",negative
"The app is good. Quora has a good community and I really enjoy the contents. But most of the time I face slow loading issue even though my internet speed is fairly fast. So, I think this is one area which can be improved vastly.",positive
Use this faithfully several times a day and love it! Super easy to navigate through.,positive
This app is the most helpful learning material for the students and teachers because it helps us to do different assessment when we are not sure to our answer then we compare the answer we get to the others.,positive
"It is SO slow and I can barely do anything. If you fixed it I would give 5 stars but until that happens, nope.",negative
"I am getting problem recently as now whenever I open app, it shows No Internet connection always. But at same time i could access YouTube and Facebook without any issue. I hope you would understand what I am trying to say.",negative
I downloaded the app years ago and used to be able to read all of the answers to a question of interest. Now you only get the most popular answer. One of my other frustrations is when you click on something to comment the app just takes you back to the top of the page instead of resuming your experience. Please fix.,negative
"It always shows no internet connection even if I can effectively use other applications, even you tube videos without any buffer. Plz fix it. Very pathetic experience.",negative
"On top of my mobile phone I get to see internet speed. While using other apps I get to see a speed of 15 to 40 mbps but while using Quora app, I will see 5 to 100 kbps only. And guess what, when the app is not able to load even after 30 to 45 seconds, frustrated, I will close the app and will start doing something else. And this happens every time.",neutral
Its great without app.. Developers are so stupid ..everytime app shows no internet connection..,negative
It's not opening. Just a screen shows up saying no internet connection. How is that when I am having superfast internet !?,negative
"All Good, the app is great, but they didn't enroll a dark mode yet, I will come back and put 5 stars when they release a dark mode!! Edit: Now they have Dark mode, and it's cool, 5 stars",positive
"Plenty of valuable information, discussions, groups, and plenty more. It's pretty much undeniable.",positive
This is the best app ever! So much info Ive learned so much. This app has helped me through the worst heartache of my life. My topic has mainly been living with & loving a Narcisist. At least I was soothed with facts. Everyone needs to educate themselves. Knowledge is Power! Thank you Quora!,positive
"Quora shows 'no internet connection, Try again' message. Not able to open app. Tried all possible methods like clear data, force stop, checking settings to allow quora to use data and wifi, reinstalling app, restarting phone, disabling google smart lock. But no use. Quora not working on android mobile. Can developers help on this issue.",negative
"I have never ever thought that we may have such a effervescent technology and that's how is study is an easy task in today's era. As I know, we have all resources for study now even we don't need to move outside for study. We take coachings just to have assistance of a teacher when we face trouble to solve a tricky Question but we have Quora to get rid from that coaching way out. Thanks to Quora to be part of our study and to help us to find solution of each and every question.",positive
Unable to use with mobile internet. It works fine with Wifi but with mobile data shows error as No internet connection. Disappointed,negative
This is the only social media which I got latest interest to.. But on normal using I realize this app drains hell lot of battery power. I m no expert but it's just an app for reading text how heavy could it be. Also m using 6000 mah batteryüîã& it's draining like piece of cake üç∞. I initially thought its a defect on my device than I realized it's happening on almost every devices.,negative
I was regular writer. They blocked my account. I requested and told sorry many times. If there is policy violation you shouldn't accept it. Most of the person is not awared.,negative
Having trouble when using with WiFi network also network compability is very poor. I know quora is great sources of knowledge and QnA Sites but although people getting frustrated while using could be fixed,negative
"Displays ""No connection"" even with strong internet and when other apps are working just fine. Terrible app",negative
Alright I'm officially deleting this app at this point since it doesn't allow me to send long comments anymore. It used to work amazing but now it feels like with every update it just gets worse. I love the site but the app is just not working for me anymore.,negative
"From a last few updates, there have been always a bug. Sometimes it shows Internet down, post link not work etc",negative
"It sucks, everytime i tey to start the app it shows no internet. I like reading on quora but this is stopping for further use of the quora app.",negative
"From last few week always got ""no internet connection error"" while internet is working fine, I update the app, install it again but issue not resolve",negative
"App doesn't load and says internet connection error, even after using good 4g and Wifi connection. App just went from poor to worse!",negative
"Its very bad. I can not give answer to any questions and nor i can ask one. It says you can not answer this question and you have been blocked from asking questions for no reason? Even after deleting the app and disabling the notifications, the keep coming and coming on emails. I hate it. Its really dumb",negative
"I really love it, the recommendations it gives are really great and informative. The app isn't so confusing and is pretty helpful. I recommend to download this app if you want to learn more about random stuff, maybe interesting facts and all that stuff. :)",positive
"Actually the content is first class. The worst problem is , it doesn't catch internet speed even if I have top speed of 2mbps and falls to 10kbps. I would like to appreciate website of Quora, it is better than the app.",negative
"I learnt many things about life more than I did in my school. And with the recent update it's gotten faster. Dark mode too available. Great! And please include history in the app. Coz oftentimes I read good answers but I forget to save them. Later, when I try to search them I cant find those.",positive
Interface is garbage greatly needs improvement. Seems like they would have it fixed by now but nope same old garbage,negative
I would prefer web version instead. App is not smooth and user friendly.,negative
"Definitely the best Q/A app out there, made me leave Yahoo answers for good. I would still recommend adding the option of attaching a picture and a description part to your questions, for providing context.",positive
"Lots of bugs, app crashes way too many times. Frequent changes in interface is just irritating tbh.",negative
"Its a great app, learned a lot from it actually. But its slow, i still prefer the site than the app.",positive
"Worst slow app üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ ever it's so slow it never loads fast.its take 10 seconds to load each stuffs or maybe 7 seconds sometimes ...I have 6 GB ram ..it's not my but this shity apps problem,issue . And the people are too inexperienced ..",negative
"The only social media I use on a regular basis, answering questions and reading the wide variety of content. Used app for roughly 1 year (300+ answers given and a much higher view count than I would've anticipated) without any app issues.",positive
"Quite Good app, I learned lot of stuff from this application I get lot of help This is a Awesome app for beginners who want to learn and improve their communication skills",positive
First wanna say something to quora.. You are Most reputed platform for youth. And you are still in 1900. Using 3rd grade interface.. Lagging again and agin .. You should upgr your apk.. So that it can run smoothly.. Worst experience to download quora.. Its better to use in browser,negative
"Great app to pass the time. There are lots of stories, questions and people on this app. The feed is great and has very good reccomendations. I don't feel forced to keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling like other apps like Tiktok. Great app, I would reccomend it.",positive
"I dont even know why I have this app. Suggests stupid topics for me to quickly glance at and when I see the first line I dont bother. Totally bad suggested reads. Nothing suggested relates to me, like at all. A Waste",negative
"App concept is great! Most productive and informative App! But need lots of Improvements. Extremely Slow app and tonnes of gliches. Plz. fix bugs, gliches, freeze, loading speed.",positive
"I love this app so far, can get lost in new found knowledge u want to gain or understand why people behave the way they do, or many different topics w/a nice ui. Only reason it's not 5 stars is the 10+ upfront interests that u have to select become redundant & doesn't end. Happy I tried it!",positive
Day by day app is becoming worst...guys please share how you are able to ruin apps with updates..Pages aren't loading ...are you deleting some features or something..I'm curious to knowüòÇ,negative
"While using all the apps in my phone,it never buffers but while using Quora(Famous app) it buffers. So Quora team please try to fix this problem as soon as possible.",negative
So far the most balanced source of knowledge on the internet. The only platform that allows you get answers multiple experts and the experienced. I love Quora. üòò,positive
"Very useful app, especially for finding obscure knowledge that is hard to explain to a search engine and most other people have very little to no knowledge of the subject. And I suppose if you are extremely smart and concieded, this would be an excellent place to show off",positive
"Not so much the app as the platform. It is really obvious that trolls or bots are asking the questions. The perfect spelling, sentence structure, and punctuation do not reflect the quality of the question. Most questions are meant to spark drama, especially hot topics.",negative
1. Experiencing very high latencies 2. App not as responsive as it used to be,negative
"I love this app but its too laggy, additional scrolling and hard to tap the original author. Complicated to use. Don't look good visually I love the website more. Edit: it closes the app in the midst of reading. Causing me to lose track of what I am reading. I dont know what happened to quora anymore better fix this.",negative
"This is very, and I really mean it, A very colourful and vibrant forum. I love it because sometimes it's nonsense and at times it's amazing. And all the answers, here shared with strangers without being awkward is the best thing!‚ú®",positive
"Just use a browser. Excruciatingly slow, buggy, and counterintuitive. Automatic formatting always causes problems. I can indent my own paragraphs, rather than crash. Hyperlink format will hijack the whole post. Takes all day to load every page because of all the bells and whistles, and if you try to use them you might crash. The buttons are too small, I didn't mean to press that! Instead of dismissing a notification I wait while it loads a thread I don't need so I can back up and start over.",negative
Pretty bloated app which constantly tries to distract you by pushing you to perform some other activity and stay on the app. Takes a lot of taps/pages to do something like read a question & it's answer. It's very annoying how the mobile web version pushes you hard to install this app just to see any Quota search results - needs to be more focused & friendlier,negative
"Really good app for selfimprovement, the problem is that with slow internet connections you can't use it, plz have a little more attention on this.",positive
I spend most of my screen time trawling through Quora. Excellent resource for knowledge and entertainment. The app works well with no issues I can find.,positive
It's the best platform of sharing knowledge . I feel great when I see people from different languages share their thoughts throughout discussions . I do discuss various topics everyday for gaining knowledge . Recommended to all humans .,positive
I'm starting to have trouble uploading images onto the website through the app but it will upload images using the web version of the site through Google Chrome !,negative

"I enjoy Quora from time to time, Reddit too. I am not always active yet occasionally I enjoy writing and replying to some of the questions. #TheWindowTheWallTheChair",positive
"Good platform to gain more knowledge, easy to get relevant information from experts in a particular field. It is very useful for students who do self preparation.",positive
Good for the people who likes to read rather than scrolling images. app lags sometime and takes time to load,neutral
5 star for quora web or mobile browser version. I never hated it. 1 star for app. I think it need 1gbps speed. I can't track questions posted anonymously.,positive
Sometimes while scrolling automatically down votes the answers. Very slow and unable read answers without opening it.,negative
Loving the new interface. The recommendation algorithm has turned this place into an echo chamber however. That's sad.,negative
"Good App. Unlike other social media. Meant for people seeking for Knowledge, rather than marketing, ego-boost and fake appearances.",positive
"Very annoying ads and super sensitive pages. Always gets me into an ad I did not clicked nor touched consciously, and unlike yhe quora of before wherein ads ads and more ads everywhere, including click-bait ads and such. So annoying. Goodbye Quora.",negative
"I just enjoy the heck out of this place! From learning medical, mental, physical, life, on and on... Just gotta watch who you learn from! üòÅ",positive
"(Just an advice) I wish there is a pop window after restarting the app to continue from the previous page. Otherewise, I am of the opinion that browsing pages on Chrome is a better choice for me.",neutral
I love reading stories of inspiration. I also love being educated on certain topics I am not super familiar with. This App lets me do both.,positive
I downloaded the app and it does not show up on my device and it took a long time to load. Then it froze.,negative
One of the greatest resources of all kind. learning and understanding so many things. Thanks Quara.,positive

Please fix the network issue. It says No Internet Connection on my android 11 but my network is working good for others apk and web.,negative
It's absolutely wonderful to get beyond vulgar sexuality in my inbox as catch up on your dodgy site. Just in the process of deleting my account. The tone of email contents just received belongs in the gutter.,negative
Best App Ever....here it's real people...real issue's... Unlike the other App's where it's about showing off and fakeness...,positive
"The app is very unresponsive, and takes multiple seconds sometimes when clicking something",negative
I think this application should come to good use with talkback too. For this you should improve.. Please improve for accessibility.,positive
"It was somewhat better before, but now the app has become unusable. It's terribly slow. Pictures fail to load sometimes etc...",negative
"This app is an app for everyday people like you and me. It's ok no matter what kind of question or concern or thought you have, here on Quora you, are able to express every single thing that goes on in your mind. The most exciting thing though when you do you find out that you are not the only one thinking, feeling, or questioning those ideas and thoughts and feelings and you are not crazy. Way to go Quora, it's about time us little guys get heard and get answers from people who are real.",positive
"I facing some technical issues like ,the answers did't open properly in new uptate version. Quora must be concentrate on this issue. Very slow loading.",negative

"After latest update, it refuses to open in my phone. Kindly look into that, I'm disappointed.",negative
"Poor app. It hangs frequently, it doesn't launch correctly. You loose track of the answer you are reading. Needs a great deal of improvement.",negative
I love quora!! It's a great app to interact with people who have similiar interests and get real advice or opinions on any topic you can think of. Can't find the answer you are looking for? Just ask!!,positive
"Love the app; however after the latest update, I continue to get frustrated-as I am shut down every 5 minutes. No joke. Please assess and fix.",negative
"Very informative as members share their knowledge backed up with the links to topics discussed. But PLEASE make Quora app more faster, and if personal chats or immediate interaction between the user and his/her friends (as in Facebook) it would be more fun and enjoyable.",positive
The website is okay !! Though there are limitations but the app is full of bugs. Such a third class app,negative
Terrible interface one of the worst I have ever seen. Also the connection issues are terrible. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the community even then that's not your doing. Fix The App.,negative
"I wouldn't suggest downloading it. There are racists, homophobes and tons more terrible people on this app. They'll flag you if you try to tell them off and they don't listen to your appeals. The customer support is quick but useless. I had a fight with them because I changed it to my real name instead of my deadname and they had a huge problem with it. Do not get this app",negative
I love this app. There are great minds who share Great ideas about many subjects. Thank You!,positive

The update is terrible the app takes heck a lot of time to load and is actually slow in Android 10 and doesn't allow to do and read what i want hence 1 star as the developers are not doing much from few years... Please work on Ui and UX improvement ... Then i will give more than 3 stars you are losing User experience part... Quora user from long time... But very unhappy with the performance of the app,negative
"I enjoy it very much I find it interesting there are many things in my email I have to send to spam because I don't care for it but Quora is not one of them. I find it very helpful. You know how it is when you get an add, email, or text, that you automatically know it's not for you we'll to each their own so to speak. I personally think this Quora app is great it's free, which is the best thing, plus there are no boundaries you can talk and ask about anything that's why it's so great.",positive

"So, I'm in the middle of typing out a reply when my phone switches to settings on its own. Deletes the entire post except for 2 lines I had written 10 minutes ago... This app should seriously be considering saving drafts much more often than it does. My recommendation would be to give users the ability to set an autosave function in the app with modifiable time intervals. Would be really helpful.",negative
"This place always has very insightful, and intelligent reviewers to the questions that you think of randomly and/or similarly to many other people. It's a place where any question, no matter how simple, controversial, elaborate, or complex, someone will give you their view or knowledge regarding an answer. It's a great place if your seeking outside perspectives, a second opinion or just an answer you need to help propel you forwards and commit to your first thought.

"First of all we shouldn't be forced to download the app. If we are not allowed to view content via the mobile website, why don't they take down the website in the first place? The web site experience is better than the app experience. Other than dark mode, the app offers no advantage over the mobile website. On the contrary the app is horribly slow.",negative
"Interesting responses. Mostly thoughtful ones on most matters I have come across. The software seems pretty okay. Overall, it's been a positive experience.",positive
Application doesn't works properly. if I click on a notification to follow most of times the application fails to load. And this has happened several times in the last few years. Big thanks for being a wonderful platform with such authentic information from the best sources and that too free but the application has some issue,negative
"Cool app, but too many people asking me weird questions that seemed directed at a single person, joke questions, or questions that aren't really questions. Also far too many notifications, to the point of being spam.",negative
Take too much time to load and sometimes automatically click the answer... Don't know what's the problem..,negative
It's an ok app but every once in a while it has to be uninstalled and reinstalled as it quits functioning correctly.,negative

"Very bad experience.. Whenever I'm trying to read some content, it always shows someone went wrong. Almost in every news. That's is the only reason for giving 1 star üåü rating .",negative
Look i like the idea.You ask questions or you discuss statements it is good.But pls make an update.There are too many bugs.For example when there is a notifician i click it and instead of sending me to that comment it sends me to home page of app.And when u exit app suddenly all things are gone.I think that this app is based on chrome.And it does not stop posting links while writing comment.,negative
"This is the place where I run to for entertainment and to gather knowledge. The majority of answers I've received upon posting an inquiry were really helpful and supportive. Some are just downright negative, but I'm a realist so I get to see both side of responses which is a plus. But a small percentage are just morons. I may fit into the moron catagory but I haven't received any critical replies so I guess I'm in the clear.. Maybe..",positive

"Great app for learning and getting good experiences the thing I hate is that some inappropriate or sexual content are clearly available without any restriction even small kids use this app, so there should be restrictions to some level so that inappropriate content will not visible",negative
Occasionally there are silly questions but answers are often quite well informed by people that seem to know what they're writing about.,positive
"Quora is one of my favourite apps (or websites). It's one in which I learn so much. I find it so eye opening as well addictingly entertaining. I could visit this app for hours.

"App is slow sometimes even if you internet connection is good. Glitch and lag is still a problem. Can't go through brower. Search results are bad , Google give you better search results than this app. They block you from adding comments by telling you have violated our quora policy and even they don't which of there policy were violated. No improvement has been made even after so much users. It's privacy practices are horrible.",negative
App is good due to its content but terrible in functionality. App load & run too slowly. Just very basic functionality. Better to use it on web rather than app.,negative
Keeps crashing after the last update. Not functioning as the web version.,negative

"They seem more interested in protecting or fostering negative child like opinions of women.

"I really love Quora, and I used to only access it through the website. It has spaces for basically anything, whether it be musical interests or animals, TV shows, etc. The reason I gave the app only 4 stars is because sometimes it will freeze while I'm in the middle of writing something, kick me out, and when I get back in nothing is saved. Besides that, it's great. You can interact with different people and have questions answered, while answering them yourself as well.",positive
"Very very slow, just too irrating ,, & takes lot of internet but even take a lot time to open a single page.",negative
"This app has caused so much frustration to me. I once saw an answer to a question that I really liked but after it got switched off by accident I couldn't find it again. I felt a whole day trying to find it. I couldn't get an author because it was anonymous. I tried quoting what I remember reading but there's no ""quote an answer"" search function. If there's one thing I'd really like added is a function like that.",negative

"I love it why because it has a lot of things to learn know and ask.ü•∞ü•∞.. But it has a lot of antireligious, pornographic, and other bad things. So, you should use it at least 13 yr old or older probably with supervision and at young never at all especially without supervision.",positive
Overall good app and yes it gets kind of boring at times but there's nothing they can really do about that and I mostly like the debates and stuff like that. I do not like that they take away some of your comments for no reason when it's not even anything bad and then you have to go through the whole process and sometimes not even get your comment back and there are some minor errors that I get past easily.,negative
"Great community. Well thought-out answers from knowledgeable and experienced people. Suitable for both technical answers and advice. Many contributors have a sense of humor as well. Spam may be found on smaller questions. Moderation can be overzealous. Edit: Docked 1‚≠ê for forced updates. Edit 2: Unusable. Some actions open Chrome, even though I use Firefox, while up/downvotes don't register, and comments don't load at all. The app has only gotten worse over the years, will only use on browser",positive
"The reason behind i am giving one star is that, this app isn't that smooth, I mean whenever i open the app it takes about 1 minute to open that page. It's very irritating.. kindly fix it",negative

You're doing amazing job no doubt in that. It would be great if you put little more attention on user interface. It is cluttered right now. I agree it is text oriented application but still it can be designed in more better way. Hoping for the best UI. Thanks!,positive
"UNDERRATED app! Whenever I search up the questions, I always end up clicking quora's site on chrome. It's awesome that there are so many experts responding to my questions on Quora. And the responses were professional. Which made me trust the app even more! And, actually, there is some motivational content and advice inside the app. You simply need to follow a community so that you can see the updates on a regular basis. It's also entertaining to read random stuff on Quora. Thanks devs",positive

I waited and waited....nothing sent and the screen not tell any... I got bored of just reading without being able to ask or send...!",negative
"I love this app, my only gripe is that the interface is a little confusing. It's kind of hard to figure out how to answer a question. When you think you're answering a question, what you're really doing is commenting on someone elses answer. Also, it's sort of confusing to figure out how to go to someones Quora profile.It just takes a while to figure it out. So yeah, my only suggestion would be to make things a little clearer on how to properly use Quora to get the most out of your experience.",negative
I like some questions. Other questions people post can be easily found. I think that I subscribed to too many questions. It is difficult to keep up with reading. I still think that I have a lot to learn about the platform.,positive
Actually the mobile version is pathetic! It's better to use on computer. But a good place to learn new perspectives.,negative
Works fine in general. The language switcher doesn't work. The SRE team needs to do a better job of keeping the endpoints up. Every then and now components go offline.,negative
Such a useful and content based app. everyone should have it in their phone to gain knowledge about whatever field.The highlighted feature is to ask any doubt in any topic we can get answers from many Quorans. That's the most special option in this. I loved that. Tq keep enjoying üî•,positive

"Quora used to be great....but not now.

This application is very good to the people who are curious about to learn new things. IN MY PERCEPTION...!!!! QUORA APPLICATION MUST GIVE DOWNLOAD OPTION FOR IMAGES TO THE USERS. THEY CAN EASILY DOWNLOAD THE IMAGES THROUGH IT. THIS IS MY CONCERN.,positive
I really love Quora and its helpful community. I used to use the web version. But this app here is really slow. I gotta tap a button like 4/5 times to make it open. So make the all faster and its perfect!,positive

This app is SO helpful. You get real life experiences from people and advise they've picked up along the way. I highly recommend especially if you're going through a hard time,positive
Absolutely agree. Do a thorough check on a breeders background and breeding space / environment before deciding to buy one. Most righteous breeders claim best suited environments but you always need to do a thorough check. It's ridiculous to put a price tag on a pet! Rather save one! Also guage the breeders life. You'll either see a passion or an unwanted obscure obsession. Genuine breeders are truly passionate and breed in natural circumstances in the best suited environment.,neutral

"Why do I have to suddenly change my name? After being on the app for about 4+ years, why is it now saying that my username is inappropriate? It clearly isn't if it lasted 4+ whole years. I think it's because of the argument I had with customer service, they're probably being petty because I was right.",negative

Personal data didn't get uploaded that easily. Public traffic and attention is very low on personal channel.,negative
I'll need to create a new e-mail to see if I can log into the Quora app. I'm astonished that the creator of this app would expect me to relinquish my private Google and/or Gmail password. No way!,negative
It is a very useful and knowledge acquiring platform. Most useful one to improve English.,positive
This is a great app to get answers for things that maybe arent a serious matter but stuff that Google doesnt share. Dont trust an app with more serious things though and use a reliable source on google or a person to get the information. But for the less serious things it's a great outlet to get the answers you need.,neutral
"Quora doesn't want you to use a browser and so they keep making it impossible to use your browser by bringing up a pop-up and insisting that you download this horrible app. The problem with it is that you can't search more than one thing at a time on it ,you can go back and forth but if you're trying to do a little research to produce an answer your very limited in what you can do with the app. Also the font is so small that it is almost impossible to read.",negative

Bad UI I have never ever seen before. Lagging and lagging not smooth UI. I hope as soon as possible you will fix this problem.,negative

Quora stop ignoring us. You know that lots of people having very slow opening. It takes 15-20 seconds to Boot. And message option is also buggy. And where the hell is feedback inside the app? How to send bug report. Now I'm using Quora via browser or webview. Fix it ASAP.,negative
"Although I am new to using the Quora App, so far I am really enjoying it! It's fun to browse different spaces and ad new ones of interest to your feed to follow. Spaces to follow for anything and everything. The questions fellow Quora users ask to be answered by peers is my favorite part. The answers that get upvoted can insight laughter, and at other times tears or heartache. Following spaces that I relate to, or topics I find interesting helps me to restore a lil faith in humanity.",positive
Why the hell it takes so much time to open the app. After clicking on the app I always have to wait for at least 10 seconds to see something on the screen. Its performance is going down every day.,negative
"I don't think why the app is very slow.At first I thought might be there is a problem in my network connection , but the issue was within the app , although it's a nice app but most of the times(by this I literally mean most of the time üëà)it's just stop working or work very slow which gives immense frustration . Please solve it fast coz in this era of 4G and 5G , we can't handle this 2G speed.",negative

"The app has stopped working. It says ""Something stopped working"" and to try refreshing, but nothing changes when I refresh.",negative
I love the blurbs on such a variety of topics. I dislike the ads/like commercials. At time they are both frustrating and way too many.,negative
Excellent app for answers about any topic one has interest in. I've been a part of this community for years and still think it is worthy of attention.,positive
"I have to give this app the full 5 stars because its probably the best way to kill time whenever needed. if your like me and you like to fill your head with mostly useless knowledge while trying to kill some time this app will bring you endless hours of joy.

"It is a very nice application, provides useful informations for individual's use in daily routine",positive

"Either it's extremely slow, buggy or doesn't work, because after clicking a link in my email it just hangs there with a white screen. Have to go back to using the browser. I thought the idea of creating an app was to make it better and faster than the browser? Anyways... you should just fire the app development team and concentrate on the web development team.",negative
"It has helped me to get insight on several subjects-issues, some really strange however, significant in our lives, that I often get hooked on to Quora out of curiosity. üòÅ",positive
"Exactly. I have read a lot on the subject. Being male and being in love and sexually interested in another male, it can't get more Alpha than that. That expression of male to male love is also one of the greatest forms of love in that it is saying: Love is more important than reproducing. I have a lot to say on the subject, both on homosexual and heterosexual expressions of love. Heterosexual reproducing is the most corrupt overrated expression of love - it is the appirence of love. Out Space",positive
"Very addictive & good. I wish they allow to upvote a question also because asking sensible questions is the need of the day. The only issue imo is their AI moderation at times, when you'll scratch your head to think what wrong was written in your flagged answer/comment.",positive

"""Something went wrong."" You need to get good developers Quora. Either the testing team is overlooking so many bugs and errors or the development team is not capable of a responsive and fast UI.

It's an awesome app. If we have doubt in any aspects it will complete clarification over that doubt within a certain time.,positive
Loved it until its so buggy it doesn't work anymore. I have to keep reinstalling it and it still won't load. So annoying.,negative
The app is very good it solves maximum of your questions. But the reason I gave 4/5 rating is its functioning speed. The app is literally takes time to load.,positive
"I would rate this higher as it is one of the apps I use every day, but it is so damn slow. Load times are frustrating.",negative
"Quora as an app is good. But there's an issue in the app. Some times in between it shows on the page "" No internet connection, try again"". And it stays like that for days.

Even after switching off my wifi, trying with mobile data, trying to connect to hotspot, nothing worked .",negative

"It is becoming a heavy app now, takes more time to load the content even after getting connected to a good speed internet.",negative
"As I am new on Quora, the interface made me confused sometimes because I am searching for options I don't find them easily, I hope Quora team will make improvements in the app.",negative

I didn't even got a single notification of them getting collapsed. Other people on Quora told me that they are collapsed. Resolve this issue immediately!",negative
this app takes forever to load. And I have one of the best internet connections and device specs. Quora has outlived its peak. time to move on to some other app.,negative

"Good app, but I want to open links with Firefox, not Chrome. There is no way to change this. Also, I cannot rotate to landscape view. Other apps do the same thing, too. Which means I cannot use the kickstand built into my phone protection case. Thanks!",negative

"I'm editing my review and rate for now. The app content is excellent, but the app is extremely slow especially when navigating pages, opening app from notifications, toggling sidebar menu, messages etc. I'm pretty sure this app is kinda built using regular pages instead of using native android and ios. It would be good if it is built on top on native platforms, so it can perform faster on ui perspective. I want to see it in the future, because I love using Quora and I'm a big fan.",positive
"As an English learner, I wanna use this app to learn English. But I cannot easily find the contents that interest me much. Whatever, it's a good app.",neutral

Very good information about not just covid-19 but so much more. Never fails to deliver.,positive

"There is no ""unsubscribe from all emails"" function. To stop receiving all Quora emails, I'd have to go to each space I'm in and deactivate the email preference. That's long and tedious. The lack of a deactivate button for ALL email notifications is a cheap, malicious excuse to keep sending users unwanted emails.",negative

I used to really enjoy reading Quora but now the content quality is diluted it's a mix of 9gag and reddit. I keep getting memes and answers which uses pictures as clickbaits. The images used as the thumbnail has increased which makes it harder to find good answers to questions instead it shows the ans which uses an image as a response. I really hope we could control the type of content that is visible. I am on Quora TO READ from good writers not to scroll memes. We got insta for that.,negative

"Why is it so horrible,unintuitive to use & a pain to use? Why is the app size so massive? Why does it force me to use it why don't i have a choice? Also when i clicked on an article/digest from my email why did it lead it to my digest why not open the article/story that i wanted to read? Needs more optimization for low end devices. It takes a long time to load up the requested article/story to show up.Tapping on the profile in the left corner takes a long time to show up anything.",negative

Great stories but a lot of the them will not pull up and I will read the commits if they will work to see what the subject is about.,neutral
"Quora has a strange type of user participation structure, where the user is forced to comply with unreasonable requirements. For example, I cannot use a handle, but have to use my real name, similar to Facebook. A handle is a name. To me, this defeats the purpose of free access of online information, and seems immoral when the info originates with the user, unlike a school which provides info. It is the new way to control and sell a commodity (data) and reminds me of slavery to a degree.",negative

"Mainly a bunch of fake computer-generated questions they're not reasonable or realistic and in many cases, literally not answerable at all. And now for the past 3 days every question that I answer gives me a note back saying illegitimate address cannot reply.

"Hello! Quora is a very fun site/app. The discourse is more intelligent than on any social media site these days. However, the app could be programmed a little better. It uses up a lot of RAM data and sometimes crashes other apps which have things like music running in the background. Sometimes, I am unable to type an answer because the text box does not show up. Some other times, the text entry box will begin underneath the title text, a GUI layout issue. Please improve :) otherwise very good!",positive
"Very much slowed down and massacred! Before this update was better. Slower than before this update. Changes were made but which harm more than help the user.

"Reading other people's questions and answers is fun but this app has an unacceptable flaw. The character limit on questions is ridiculously strict. ""Keep it short and to the point"", it says. Not everything in life is simple. Some questions are complex. If I oversimplify a complex question, people will think it makes no sense. I'd give an example, but the character limit on THIS is too strict for THAT, which means most people will think my review makes no sense. Great job everyone. *Thumbs up*",negative

This is an excellent platform . People express a lot of things over a wide array of aspects wheather it is education or social skills or so on.

Font suddenly decreases in size on Quora Feed after you download the app. Difficult to read. Why the smaller font you ask? I don't know. Ask Quora. I uninstalled this app after uploading it twice. Thought I'd give it another chance. Nope.,negative
The major drawback is that you cannot delete messages or even chat history with others in this app. Also the app is very much lagging. Media uploading may sometimes take decades.,negative

"I originally joined a question and answer site with a real name policy. It has turned into nothing but another social media site with shares of other people's question, memes and all kinds of other social media rubbish.

Good experience!! I enjoy reading the variety of questions and answers.,positive
"Very interesting in terms of topics. That said, I do not like the page layout which makes you click on ""more replies"" over and over and over, instead of being able to scroll down and see all the replies in a continuous roll. Additionally, there seems no logic in the way they censor and delete replies. I have had replies deleted for no other reason than suggesting that an obviously mentally disturbed individual seek professional mental health practitioners.",negative
Good app but recently it shows no internet connection Tried all ways like reinstall ; change permission ; clear cache etc but of no use,negative

It has a lot of information on various subjects but the sources and writers are not credible.,negative
"Worst.. It slows down every then and now. It does not load while other apps work fast. I do not know the problem of quora, why don't they invest on improving their app instead of taking millions of useless ads. If it was possible I could have given zero stars. The most buggy app I have ever seen. Takes years to load just textual content, often slows down while posting an answer and irritates a lot.Quora is the best plateform to test patience rather than knowledelge. Keep it up Quora team.",negative

This platform has lost it's charm. It is jow full of just memes and fact pages . Every recommendation is for some useless fact page which is clickbait with some inappropriate image and title. Uninstalling quora for ever never coming back...,negative
"Forced from browser to app. The idea of quoara is awesome, the webside worked flawless. At some point, quoea started sending people to their useless app, which ruined the experience. Jumping ro unrelated stuff, hiding answer, links from E-mail notifications puts you ""nowhere"". Best suggestion would be for quora to open webdagene, and delene the app from all appstores.",negative
"I like many others felt the need to download the app just to give my rating. To be fair I have checked the app a little. However, no matter what I think about the app, the fact that I was forced to download it to continue totally changes anything positive I might say. It pops up over the whole screen with no way to 'X' out. Hopefully, this will change because I enjoy Quora and will happily come back if I can at the very least find an 'X' to get by the ""suggestion""",neutral

"Its an awesome platform for solving doubts, learning a lot of new things and gaining knowledge.",positive

The app is great but the links to external sites for sources and more information mostly does not work,negative
I'd give it a near perfect 5 star if a current bug was fixed. In some spaces I'd want to post something but it takes forever and ages to load and never finishes.

Laggy and heavy. Doesn't load most of the time. Please restructure or program this app again. Everything is good but the app is not optimized be it network or performance,negative
"The app seems very sluggish as to what I remember from downloading it before. I downloaded it to write answers or comments. The version on my mobile browser just makes it almost impossible to write answers or even ask questions for that matter. Now as to the platform, I get some really good answers from people who sincerely try to answer my questions, but there can be some really nasty comments and answers that are very insulting or abrasive.",negative
Old version not working properly after updates released... That's how they compel us to download latest version...,negative

One thing I noticed was my 7t is top notch in fingerprint reading ability, and despite the low battery bug from April, Ive NEVER had a problem with my phone, other than dealing with stubborn apps/pages. Also, my 7t has never overheated. But my 9pro got EXTREMELY overheated about 5 days into use, and the phone was in my pocket, ironically. I'll keep the 7t until I'm bored of the Android 12 update, and until the next 10pro has survived a healthy update for 30 calender days.",positive
Great idea but can inundate you with a lot of noise. Important to be careful what you actually take as truth on this app. But definitely some kernels of wisdom.,neutral
"Absolutely Rubbish. It used to be good at a time. If you are searching for a question then it is fine, but if you want to browse, you will find an AD AFTER EVERY QUESTION.

The app shows 'No Internet connection' all the time i open it although my Internet is workimg fine with all other app.,negative
The app is too slow and takes time for a single page to open...I downloaded it for the first time and had to delete it cause I was not impressed,negative
It's take very long time to refresh itself and still end up with showing irrelevant and very few numbers of results.,negative

As an individual in a free society who zealously believes if it's woke it's broke, and for never giving me a reason for banning me for two weeks last December, it loses that fifth star.

"App has some quirks which I think is due to connecting with the website and specific computer or mobile software.e.g blank,no access.The content which is considered risque, against the status quo, forward,brash,rude or taboo are the best parts. Scientific explanations and talking about personal downfalls are equally as revealing. The petty comebacks are expected from critics and perfectionists. Finally cheeky comments and rigid dogma s are there to be challenged, to understand other approaches.",negative
"16 MONTHS to my Comment but nobody replying I would suggest 2 improvements :- 1) Pls add a ""History"" or ""Recently Viewed"" feature. 2) Pls let us remain on the same Answer when I open Quora again from my ""Recent Apps"".

An okay app but too many bugs and slow performance which makes it very frustrating to use I would give this one a 2.5/5,negative
"3 stars because it's a good app but what seems like on every topic is highly depressing, sad or just negative. If you've got depression or a fear of death don't use this. Constant posts about death and just depressing topics on everything. It's better than Facebook though, I'd say that. Facebook is rubbish though but not better than Reddit. Reddit it better.",negative
"I can't express that how many confusions mostly career related have been sorted because of this platform. When there was literally no one to guide, Quora made it easy for sure.",positive
Spams you to download their app. People should have the choice to access the website without the app.,negative

"It is extremely good application and medium to gain, give and share information. It Encourages knowledge about Particular Aspect.so , I am giving 4 stars.",positive
"Great app! It recommends topics that you actually would find interesting and no ads or distractions. The only issue, and this is an issue with Quora itself and not the app, is that you can't add elucidation details to the question when you post one. Otherwise great platform and great app!",positive

Not that usefull i used quara to find answers that i cant found on Google and YouTube but it does not work people are not that well qualified to answer your question its because of bad education system they only gives answers only what is written on books and when i ask them again they dont reply other bad thing is it gives spam notifications which are stupid and not related to science or anything.,negative

"There are interesting questions on here, but way too man questions asking ""what is the best thing you saw on the internet today?"", and other questions like that. People need to get a new gimmick that doesn't copy everyone else for interaction. Try being interesting. Also the layout in this app is horrible, way too cluttered and busy. When I click on a post I expected to see answers, not having to click again and coming across the most cluttered reply section ever.",negative
"The quora app on android is my favorite way to engage quora. Bravo very well done. I love night mode as it is easy in the eyes and reminds me of monochrome monitors.

"App is currently unusable due to a glitch directly related to the recent Google Chrome update. When I revert to the factory installed version of Chrome, the app works fine. When I open the app, the entire screen shows multiple stripes of 1 - 2"" of the same info. When scrolling down, the same layers follow. Similar to old analog TV when the vertical blanking interval was set incorrectly. Instead of a cg response asking me to fill out a form, developers need to USE the app to see the problem.",negative

The last update comes with a lot of bugs. Quora I know you can do a better job than this. Is quite unacceptable that you haven't a proper UI for mobile devices. It is just a webview. The sadness.,negative

Love this app! Helped me understand things I did not know. I was married to a narcissist for 23 years and didn't even know it until he died. He was trying to divorce me at the time to leave me too depressed to work and with nothing. When he died I started reading in Quara about narcissists. It all was so familiar. Every statement! It helped me to understand what had been going on all those years. It actually made me feel better about myself! I understand that it wasn't my fault it was all him.,positive

"Good but some of the questions are just getting silly. Like, 'why is Brad Pitt a good actor?' It used to be a rather intellectual app with intectual points of view. These days, the answers usually morph into something far removed from the question, with commentators trying to usurp each other for the top spot.",negative

Quora English has become a worst place. It is full of junks and memes rather than information. Good writers or not recognised.

It would be better if the program writers change their algorithm pattern in a way that helps good writers.,negative

Its a great shame. This used to be an excellent website that distinguished its self from the superficial alternatives such as facebook and instagram. However rather than containing the mind expanding questions and answers that it used to - it is now plagued with irritating low quality memes. They have their place - but not on Quora. Whatever good is left on Quora is so tiresome to find after sifting through all the rubbish that it is no longer worth finding. Quora has gone to sh**.,negative

It used to be a good platform now it is a leftist propoganda machine. Many top writers have left and quality of content has reduced drastically.,negative
This place has a large mensa level IQs that answer any question in their field in a down to earth understandable layman's terms. There are areas of more subjective discussion. Something for everyone that wants to learn something. I'm a bloviating buffoon myself so I just SWAG my way around.

"Im sure it has good intentions but theres thousands of repetitive questions and even thousands more stupid questions. I prefer this over a subreddit because people actually respond with facts instead pretending to be at&t and saying something like ""did you unplug it and plug it back in"".

App is now horrifically slow to load. I can load reddit in 1/4 of the time!,negative
Edit: downgraded to 2 stars solely based on the app. The mobile platform (you will endlessly be harassed to download it if you don't use it) has become increasingly unstable and fixes are increasingly rare. Not sure what issues they have with their infra/platform team but it's a very inconsistent experience. I absolutely love Quora.

I do like the different spaces within the app itself. But that is the only good thing because people leave such nasty comments and remarks when you ask one simple question.

Used to be a great app but now I hate their content algorithm. The home feed shows the same type content over and over again. It lacks diversity now.,negative
The old version is better than the new one and Need improve more. Somethimes the application said network problem but my connections is fine and Maybe quora should make a lite version.,positive
It's a great platform but there are some limitations and inconsistencies in user experience and available features across platforms which is frustrating. There is a lack of transparency around the voting system and around investigations/audits. The spaces are great but need more reporting and flexibility in features but they are improving.,negative
"Yeah !!! Instalead of wasting time on other social media like instagram, we can use that time here it's useful!!!!üòä",positive

The app-why it's suddenly so bad.I am trying so much but it's sooo bad that i can't change the language.. it's all white.. loading...,negative
"Definitely not using it now a days. It was much more better 3-5 years back when memers were not there. Everybody was soo good but now a days, people are flooding content on quora from google search, from instagram etc. What do they think? We don't use those platforms. Apart from that, report feature doesn't work on quora, nothinh gets remove here.",negative
"I'm loving the interaction on this app during these pandemic times. Fast and reliable service and I was delighted at the full answer I got to my question.

I like how you can ask a question and for the most card in a pretty good answer from the people at answer the questions. I got one that was a bit graphic and nature about cross-dressing during the day. I think the people that post everything up need to look at some of these comments that people are making. Because you never know if somebody under 18 might be looking at some of this stuff,positive
"For me it just the opposite, I can't stop getting Quora info all day, it was to much, so I went to unsubscribe and there was a choice for only weekly conversation. So you can also go there and change yours to dayly communication and then you will be set to talk all day. To everyone on here I wish you much peace and happiness, Blessed Be!",neutral

"App is very useful but it's very slow, it loads so slowly, I then have to close the app It's frustrating",negative
At first impression the app helps with quality answers to the questions related to learning and tech. It also helps in knowing facts and topics that are in public interests. But recently its happen to fill with lot of nonsense questions and some teenage biographies. And searching gets tqngled with many irrelevant topics. Its becoming like Facebook where you see shitposts,neutral
Terrible glitches. The pages and feed do not load properly. Pages are half cut and questions keep on glitching.,negative
What's with the new bug? I can't read past 3-4 lines. All the advertisements and in-answer images crowd up the screen in ugly manner. Please solve this asap.,negative
"I've been reading Quora from years and it shocks me completely to see that ""Quora"" is literally forcing me and everyone else out there to download the app? I understand you need downloads but for that it is better to focus on the product instead of eroding customer satisfaction by forcing them to download. Like, no-one told you that before?",negative
"It forces to use updated versions, otherwise the app won't worküò°üò° why is that so? Why wouldn't the app open if I don't update it?",negative
"Brilliant app, engaging forums... We live and we learn, and this is a good place/space to do this. üëåüèæ",positive
It now fixed the bug on Meizu phones. I can finally use this app on my phone after 2 and half years.,positive
"I love the service, but hate the mandatory app updates every now and then. The updates are too frequent, and in case its not updated it fails to load on phone. Love Quora, hate the app version!",negative
It has become worse.None of the answers open properly.The user interface also lags heavily.I don't know how to solve it.I request the quora support team to resolve the issues at the earliest and help to use the app as earlier.,negative
This app is really slow. It has so many bugs! I couldn‚Äôt even report a problem. Hope you'll fix it soon.,negative
"Good app to get answers to your questions from experts who have real experience. There is an emphasis on discipline and quality of answers. It is not good for the contributors though. Our answers don't really matter at the end. Also, there's no freedom, can't comment freely without getting reported. They even froze my account despite me using my real name. These days, there are just too many people bragging all the time on the app. Heavy moderation, drop in the quality of answers make it worse.",negative
"It's a good app. I would've rated it 5 stars but the app has too many issues and bugs. When I write a comment that I would like to post later it doesn't give me the ""save draft"" option. However, when I've written nothing the ""save draft option is available. There's also the notifications which don't work. I mean I get notified via email much more than the actual app notification. The app also has a tendency of me having to restart it so I can access it. Don't know why.",negative
This app helps to fetch on informative furnished ideas and connect to various Experts around the world.,positive
"this app often doesn't load anything, it's been awesome for months, but recently this app got so many bugs.",negative
"Recently, the app cannot be used. I thought its the internet connection but when I tried with youtube, it loads fine. I tried reinstalling, still doesnt work.

REPLY: I've already reported the bug, but the problem is, becoz of that bug I'm not able to coppy my profile link, please help.",negative
"I like Quora, but I definitely don't like to be CARPET BOMBED constantly with notifications that some algorithm hopefully thinks has my interest..... I expected better from Quora...... It was much simpler to uninstall and use the website, rather than trying to figure out how to stop the deluge of spam. A pity because there is many genuinely knowledgeable people contributing and respect to them.",negative
"Every one is student in there life you need to learn from others knowledge and experience,so quora is the best platform for every one to ask and answer the questions...",positive
Its good but there is one bad thing about this app. It doesn't have that much features or freedom to express our thoughts while typing a question. Maybe you could add a feature where apart from a question there could also be a description box where if you type it it will give a detail description of the question and also whatever he/she wants to tell to get the expected responses or to tell something before they judge you.,negative
It's a really good app. It can clear all your thirsts. It's safe and doesn't contain any bad content! And it is for all ages. It also contains many informative articles and anyone can post anything or ask anything I this app! Lastly I would say that it is a really very good app!,positive

But my Quora feed is full of unwanted and silly answers and posts, I wish that my feed has the posts and answers of the Topics I follow , I want my Quora feed to be personalised, I wish Quora feed is free of unwanted content, I tried muting topics, but it is of no use. This is the problem. So I request on behalf of the majority of Quorans , Add a feature, that our Quora feed only has content of the Topics we have followed.",negative
The platform provides a perspective arena to seek knowledge and provide accurate and objective intuition,neutral

"I love the questions and answers here but I had a challenge on your app, im unable to read the articles posted when I'm notified in my mailbox",neutral
The app is quite good but personally just one thing bothers me and that's the 'increase in nudity' on Quora.,negative
Nowadays the app is not at all satisfactory.... I tried using this on Google but there too it was not working properly!! Kindly look into the problem..,negative
"i open the app, scroll for a few seconds, and now a bunch of questions are overlapped. to be fair, i do have a low spec phone, but this website is very basic. it's just text and sometimes images, how is it this bad! and the developers will just say ""oh were sorry! go to this troubleshooting link"" instead of actually fixing it.",negative
I prefer if Quora is opened with a browser because all pages can be changed to the desired language. so please add a translate tool in your application like Chrome browser I will love to install it,positive
This app is really annoying and i hate. I cannot go anywhere platform is all so lagging and not responsive. I use other app is not problem except this one app,negative

Terrific if you like neo Nazis perverts and the like. Also zero developor review in terms of creditable information with primary sources being provided. Also lots of d&$- pics so definitely watch out for that mature content filter I mean what's not to want?,negative
"Website cuts out halfway through a reply, the app is no different. Disappointed to see that it hasn't changed 3 months later.",negative
I would rate 5 star but page loading speed is very slow. The design should be improved.,negative

Really one of the best social media apps out there. Communicating with people even in different continents. You get to argue or agree over your shared interest of any topic and that for me stands out.,positive
"Great app to answer questions, but very hard to ask questions. I've been on Quora for a year and a bit now, and not once has my questions been accepted or answered. I figure it's a waste of my time if all I'm doing is answering others.",negative
Hate that the app requires full name given the age of identity theft that we live in but then I suspect a large subset of (careful) subscribers fudge it just enough to decrease their risk. Other than that it's a mediocre app that does a basic job. Any flair is owed entirely to it's dynamic subscribers.,negative

Used this app for about 5 years and thoroughly enjoyed it. However over the past 6 months been seeing a lot of disturbing and unwanted content and clickbait. I generally enjoy reading about science and technology and occasionally social related media. But the majority of the content that is shown on is totally unrelated to my preferred topics. Examples are poor quality memes containing adult related themes of unsavoury nature. I'll miss the Quora app now that I have deleted my account.,negative
"There was a time I used to love reading quality content on Quora but all now I see is ""best screenshot"" kinda post because of which I uninstalled this aap. I am re installing in the hope that I get to read better and useful answers in future. The ""best screenshot"" kinda post is useless and mostly involve bollywood memes or other useless memes. Hope somebody will take this into consideration and work on improving the app.",negative
"What used to be a really blazing fast app, has now changed into a snail app .... takes 5-10 seconds even on WiFi just for loading the content and it is only with quora app, rest all other apps seems to he working fast. So can rule out that the internet is slow or the phone is slow.... seems like developers got lazy now.",negative
"look, i love LOVE quora, but the mobile app is just not so great, my phone has been lagging SO MUCH everytime i open quora, but when i close it for a while, it stops lagging. the problem about lagging is still there. please i beg yall, please fix this annoying bug.",negative

Very bad experience with this app. This app is very slow and takes a lot of time to load. And i don't want to wast my time on this app. Insted of this i will search my problem on Google. I am installation quora.,negative
"It's therapeutic for me they have categories to choice from whatever your topic you want to talk about. It's almost for me like going to a group session and discussing an issue, almost counseling group sessions without the in person atmosphere.",positive
I love this app but why one star? It sucks it lags soo bad when i press on a question it goes to the question above it sooo annoying and also when i write an answer the lag omg i cant understand why cant you guys fix this dont you see many people are complaining or you dont even care about them? Please fix this then i will give 5 stars,negative
Fine app but takes a lot of time to load and clutters up my feed with irrelevant stuff from different spaces I have know idea nor interest of.,negative
The app doesn't open anymore or load anymore... And that a shame given how it was when it actually worked.,negative
"Overall good idea for an app but if I get a notification of a post Id like to read and I click it, other than taking me to the post, it takes me to the log in page(as if I had to log in every time) and when I do log in, it takes me to the main feed leaving me without the post I wanted to see initially and no way to find it in a practical manner. Frustrating to say the least. Fix it and you will merit mote stars. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem..",negative

"It's really cool, when I read some stories or spaces to read I feel it relaxing, or at least for me :) But it takes a little of time to change one language to another one...",positive
"It's an extremely interesting website. The content is often insightful as well as entertaining. My only complaints usually involve tedious participants who lack perspective and emphaty as they try to impose their own distorted agendas. However, the good in the site heavily outweighs the bad. A better search engine to maneuver around the site would be a positive improvement.",positive
Nice place for knowledge in older times now a days only full vulgarity / nudity available here. There is any policy for content filtration in quora. Afraiding to open the app so much irrelevant content like it is a porn memes app. Please do something to fix it otherwise quora will lost.,negative
Current version of Quora just sucks the page is like overlay on the pictures it just ain't working fine.,negative
"Its really a time saving app. Knowing new things from basics by self study is good, but would require time. But knowing things from various views of well trained technicians and experts would give you better understanding of the things. This app is not only knowledge giving, but also being short and content oriented really is time saving. Quick and better knowledge sharing is efficient to boost up the academic/ technical interests.... Well done Quora.. Thank you for the thought developing Quora",positive

"After update this application very slow, please maintenance the signal content in the application because i like this application",positive
I don't understand why my app keeps crashing. I have updated it to the latest version but nothing changes. Enjoying the contents of Quora wouldn't be fun when the app has bugs.,negative
Slower than my grandma these few weeks. Update in 1 min. After uninstalling and reinstalled: the app still loading for eternity. Useless. I'll take the website.,negative
"It's an absolutely great application. I get to know about most the best things from Quora and from the pages that I follow(As a student and teenager, I mostly follow the educational pages). It provides an extraordinary information in a wonderful way and from different people. And additionally,my English is improving alot while using the English version of it. Even I get to learn alot of new words and phrases. Overall, Quora is an extremely helpful aaplication. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",positive
why this app doesn't running on my phone? I can't open the app in few weeks. I've updated it but nothing was changed,negative
Instant gratification for questions that pop into your mind. Often simple answers seemingly from 12 year olds. Sometimes thoughtful ones from experts.,positive
"Frequently keep loading and loading.... After few try then showing error. It happens after version upgrade, pls kindly fix it.",negative
"The spaces I follow don't even show up in my feed no more. By some strange algorithm in the recent updates, quora has been successfully reduced to some meme-land. Removed from my favourite apps till it's returned to what attracted me there in the first place",negative
"Uodate: Went from 4 great stars to one. Of course if there was way to voice less than 1 star, then like everyone else, it'd be less! Quora allows others to attack me. But when i defend myself, well, that's bad for some reason. Quora doesn't like it when you defend yourself. Also, I dont like apps that want to know all your business anyway. Beware, once you create a ""free"" acct you can never leave. That alone is weird, gross, should be illegal. They're after as much info as possible about you!",negative
"Horrible app. Got blocked from commenting, answering questions etc because the name that i used as my screen name (my legal name) didnt match the name i used on my account (the name i go by). The appeal process is a waste of time, guilt before proven otherwise.",negative
"I think this app is the best thing since sliced bread. its better than Google. !!! The greatest thing about Quarantine is that you can actually chat with other people that might know something about what your inquiring about. Weather it be a question, a problem, big or small, a quote that maybe your just itching to get off your mind. Even if it might be a lyric or a title of a song that you might think No One could possibly know. Definitely 5 + *.....!!!!@##$$",positive

"I'm in my sixties in great shape from decades of workout out. With recent medical issues I'm now feeling the cold more severely and gone back to wearing leggings from running days which reminded me how I see myself. Focus on body form and improvement come from hard workouts and gym is where it happens. Acceptance of male leggings is a fine boundary and easily breached, however having them them under gym shorts looks hideous. The article does offer options to manage the boundary.",positive
"It's a moderate app. It's not too good but the same time not too bad. The content in this app are fantabulous. But, it strucks all the time. If I scroll it down, not responding correctly. Sometimes I want to write question or answer it's always strucks and brings lots of tension to me. That's the reason for 3 stars.Otherwise, it's a nice app. I admire the contents it has.",positive
"Everything is perfect but only one problem, the application is very slow, everything loads very slow. Please improve it.",negative
It's a great app if you want to read about different subjects that interest you. There's always interesting questions & fantastic answers.,positive
"I really like this app. Why can't the developers enable night/dark mode like other apps. This is what annoyed me the most. And irony is that I can't put it on dark mode on my S21 Ultra, but it goes on dark mode ony son's redmi k20 pro by default when phone is on dark mode! Common you got to be kidding üòí. Please enable the dark mode and I will rate it back to 5 üåü.",negative
"Good app but a bit backwards. They pay you to come up with questions, not for answering them which is the most important part. People come up with silly questions to try to make a buck",negative
Awesome App for gathering information on just about any topic you can imagine and if you can't find one you can create one. Help is always available if you need with any issues.,positive
It's a good app !! The best thing is we get to know the experience of someone where we doesn't know anything about them .... install it and have a good time,positive
"Great app, for someone who is curious. The only problem that I'm experiencing is that i get broken cards, i thought it was my device but the problem just persisted even after changing my phone.

"Tracks you everywhere!! Too heavily moderated for the wrong things. So many users with fake profiles but you can't use a psudonym with a justified reason! Even though your Google account can be varied with your real identity!

There are very good reasons some people need to remain anonymous, yet checked out by authorised monitors. Deleted, can't trust It!",negative
"Cannot sort your answers. Very weird way to navigate and find few obvious things like the questions you have asked, the answers youbhave given or if someone has answered your questions. Rather a bunch of unimportant stuffs are given more importance and notifications.

"Very buggy in spite of very frequent updates. One can't share to one's own Space, leave alone sharing with other Spaces. Notifications are too many and 99 per cent are worth weeding out or else the app will hang while contributing or sharing. SEO needs a helluva lot of improvement. Can't paste saved text from phone clipboard. Spaces are cluttered with no tags, no Sitemap, no headlining for answers.

Well I started using quora in 2016 just fo4 reading purpose . Started writing on it in 2020 (when there was complete lockdown and i had nothing to do). I gained good readership on my writings which encouraged me to write more on the platform. But the reason i rated 4 star is that i am unhappy with its monetization policy its more like they have provided you a 'monetization service' where the chances of earnings are just very slow. They should introduce monetization on hindi platform as well. Tx,neutral

good work I'm a detailed artist myself so I can appreciate your work and see things that a lot of people don't it's time to expand your talent and learn to visualize what you don't see or actually see imagining it vividly with your eyes closed go to a special place that you're fond of. a Time that made you happy or very sad with your eyes closed totally focused and vision all the little details of that place. now open your eyes and draw it because you still see it with your eyes open,positive
Not a very good app. You can't read articles which are old. They no longer appear and disappear which is ridiculous. When you click on a recent article it shows only the First lines and then you need to click again to expand it which is a very annoying thing when you are reading with a phone in one hand.its understood that you clicked on that article to read it!!,negative
"Quora is the best site for finding detailed explainations. There are the usual problems that are shared by all social media (i.e. popularity). Yet this site still shines as an example of balence between freedom and restraint. The answers are interesting and much easier to understand than Wikipedia. However the data is not unbiased. Quora is not just an information app, it is social media for the thoughtful.",positive

Awesome amazing app. It instantly connects you to an entire community of people who know or have been through what you're going through or asking about. If you are in a situation where you are looking for support or encouragement or motivation then this is definately the right place to go :),positive
"What happened to quora, first it was running fine and the next thing that happens is that it stops working on Android. You can't use it on a phone period. Not from an app and neither from a browser. The text and pictures keep on mixing together and you get this wierd merged display that does not make any sense",negative
"This app takes too much time to load the content even in fast network, That's why I rarely use this..",negative
Concept is good but the mobile app sucks. It hangs a lot and writing a long answer on app is a complete nightmare. It is full of glitches and crashes a lot.,negative

"Sometimes this app is awesome but sometimes it's just so ridiculous. If you are single or in a relationship but unhappy and your partner avoids you bc this and all other things they do are vital parts of their intricate plan to upset you, it's easy to see how they wouldd edicattheir entire life to your feels, you like to talk about you,or if u enjoy screaming at customer service anywhere that offers fun or entertainment mostly during busy times , the relationship section on here is for you.",negative

"sluggish, even on WiFi or 4G, when other apps are not. 03/20: still handles like a slug in treacle. 02/21: often has 'oops' ""something's wrong"" moments and the intellectually insulting lie that ""we're working on it"". As a site Quora is turning into Yahoo Answers, make of that what you will. As an app, technically awful. 08/21: oh great, a link I can't click. Call that support?",negative
"Reviewing after months of use. I used to love quora. But after the update It became useless. When you type a question in Google the is no way to view it on your quora app. The link always asked you go ""get the app"" and then rest is history. No question appears",negative

Experience is very bad because this App is not supported in my phone vivo y93 after update but parformens is better When I open this app in laptop,negative
Absolutely lousy as it messes up when I try scrolling to read someone's post whether that post is on Home or the read more takes me to that particular Post and then keeps over lapping the first part of that Posting making it unreadable. On top of that I can't even unsubscribe from Quora from inside the App because the account page is totally a blank and the account link on Quora website is useless.,negative

I absolutely love this app and how you can 'read people' without having to know them. It's wonderful to know what people around the world think about the topics you like and you can talk too! Go anonymous or let the world know who you are. The only thing that does annoy me is that it's turning into a meme sharing app. So many unnecessary pictures and memes on such a divine platform!,positive

I'm close to canceling any involvement with Quora because the stupid app.",negative

"Too too too much slow app and also It becomes shittier day by day, earlier this is used share knowledge, but too much pornographic content is there and there is no such prevention taken by Quora team. Maybe reason is this that those are also audience, they are also providing enough traffic and revenue.",negative

"I like this app much better than other similar apps. There aren't typically as many participants on questions/discussions, but there are far fewer trolls and people just wanting to argue. For the most part, from what I've seen, people on here clearly articulate respectful thoughts.",positive
One of the slowest apps i have experienced. Elements are continuesly jumping around when loading. App needs a lot of work.,negative
"Great and useful app! I can easily ask questions and get valuable answers. It also lets you post and read anonymously. I think Quora is far better than any social media. I feel like my time is not being wasted as I can always learn something new from the app. I call it ""Knowledge Media"". Though the app is terribly slow at loading sometimes, otherwise everything works fine. And this should be fixed. Thanks for creating such a wonderful platform.",positive

"Recent UI changes aren't completely stable. The app jams frequently. Also, I feel the 3-dots options button for each post on the feed isn't logically placed right.

So the 3-dots button should be at the bottom of the card like before, not at the top.",negative
"Why are you so annoying? Won't let me read answers without signing in and once I do sign in you won't stop nagging to install the app? Is there any particular benefit for you in this behaviour?

Quora is a good app you can learn from some questions and share your opinions. But this app have a huge problem. IT'S TO SLOW and have a POOR Optimization. And when you search it's the same thing.

"Quora is like a sophisticated, intelligent Reddit. You'll find interesting and deep conversations here. A tip: ask a question on Google, mentioning quora in the search.

good app but it's not optimised. it takes up a ton of ram and also takes about forever to load content even when I have a fast wifi connection and a decently good smartphone with Android 11,negative
"It's not a great platform for obvious reasons. There's no quality control so it's mostly trolls and idiots screaming over each other. As long as Quora makes a buck, they don't care about their reputation. But the app itself is also pretty bad. The buttons don't work have the time and using a different device doesn't work, so it's likely a systemwide problem that just isn't getting fixed. The partner program is kinda cool but there are better information sources.",negative
super explanation for the simple people like me. I have been searching for this for long time. thanks,positive
Website is much much more better than this app ui. I am unistalling this app as the website ui is more friendlier than app. I thought that app would be better but here the things are opposite.,positive
I think Quora is an amazing website and I think it keeps us all informed. and even wanna act like your to school for cool and aren't necessarily up to date with your current events or don't care to be then you can ask questions and chances are somebody's already asked it and quora has the answers posted . I just learned something very interesting I've never heard of the Waze app..üòâ,positive

this is the best app where you can share your knowledge to others and you can your your knowledge through reading out other's post. but there is one thing that need to be changed that is it's speed it takes 30-40 seconds in opening if it will be resolved than there will be no apps that will be as powerful as this is.,positive

It's rather resourceful and a good all to seek answers to inquires. which normally are hard to find or controversial in other places especially google.

Very slow app. Why does it need a high speed internet. Sometimes even Instagram can load content but not Quora on a particular internet speed. Why don't you make a lite version?,negative
"Great app. Quora has helped me out with problem solving answers at times when I've been stuck. No one person knows everything, but with this app you can be well on your way.",positive
"It is a great platform to learn about stuff, but can often have misinformation as well. Developers and admins of the app should check from time to time, and update answer responses according to the year of the question asked and the year the ans was written. often backdated ans misleads people and it is very troublesome",negative
Its not working properly... The entire screen splits when I open quora... The answer is not readable as I can't figure out where it starts from and where it ends... The sentence are jumbled up when I scroll down...,negative

"Used to be great; but, well, like all good apps, the inevitable devolution into the realm of Monetization... Since 2014, I have read and authored for Quora. Great experience when it was a ""younger"" platform. Then, the decline began as the platform got too big for itself. The folding in of ads posed as questions, the endless campaign for Stories, then Spaces. Now, Quora+ is being pushed by HIDING ANSWERS unless you subscribe, just like an online news subscription. I'm through. Was a nice ride.",neutral

About app interface. It's so hard to focus about something I mean in every aspect I see lots of words and titles. I think that app must be optimised for every uses. To use easy and elegant design.,negative

I am unable to login .. It always goes on saying invalid captcha but there is no captcha provided at the time of logging in.. I am really disappointed with this app,negative
My Quora app works terribly and I hate to say that I really do because I love the original website. It takes forever for the app to load and when it does there are huge gaps in the content and what does appear takes a long time to load as well. I don't think I have ever used the Quora app once successfully because I just can't see enough of it to make it worthwhile. I really hope you guys can fix this app for Android so I can enjoy Quora on my phone as much as I do on a computer.,negative
"I love quora, it's very easy to use, you can ask questions, answer them, post memes, and make friends online. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes it's notifications glitches, for example, I have all my notifications on, and yesterday I posted a few memes, I didn't get any notifications that someone upvoted it, but when I checked it, it had like 11 upvotes. And I created a new space recently and I don't get any notifications when a person follows me or my space.",positive
I think this is a good platform to learn and as well teach. This is where you get mental food.,positive
"Can't even login through mobile browser/ Quora app. I've been constantly asked to enter correct captcha after entering credentials, but there's no captcha option in login page. How a user is expected to enter captcha when there's no option for it ? Horrible experience.",negative
Quora was useful because it was free..The content was knowledgeable and was accessible to all. But with the introduction of Quora+... I dont think it'll prevail in India anymore.,negative
The app is clumsy. It needs to be optimized for better performance. Something like Facebook Lite.,negative
App lags a lot and takes a lot of time even when I am doing some basic thing like searching a question.,negative
Works fine except of inability to use simultaneously with other app. 5 stars though. Samsung Galaxy S10e Android 11,positive
"Loading all the time despite of full strength of interest, according to knowledge and content this is best app. Coming to maintenance it is very poor.",negative
It seemed like a very nice app to connect with people until I realized it is a subscription service that charges monthly fees. Never mind.,neutral
"When I open the app, it runs just fine. As I use it and start viewing questions and answers, it starts slowing down. If I answer a question, it slows way down. If I try to answer a second question, it will start having problems with my keyboard. I often have to close the app, clean the memory, and then I can open the app and finish writing. It does not manage memory well. This is my only app that has this type of behavior. Samsung A10e, Android 11",negative
Subscription model ruins the essence of the app. Knowledge should be free. You could have made us watch ads rather than subscription.,negative
"Quora is not a bad idea but I'm evaluating the app that stutters, crashes and simply is poorly coded. For instance, in the same phone Reddit app works well.",negative
Imma give you guys a five star over and over again üíØ This is a platform where you teach and also where you get taught.,positive
"Great place for a quick question. Superb for Dnd. Edit: they're putting things behind paywalls now. I'm out. Ads are fine, but forcing someone to pay to read something is backwards and I guarantee it's going to have a negative impact.",positive
An excellent selection of questions and answers from the USA and from England I've learnt a few things on this I recommend it,positive
For educational purpose this app is so far so good But using experience of this app disappoints me a lot. The slowness of this app needs to solve and need to make it faster like other social app.,negative
"Way too pushy with their app! The app and Quora itself is bulky and difficult to navigate. You have to click this, then that, then confirm your age, then click ""read more"" for the third time, then scroll down...applications and websites have really lost their drive towards innovation, high quality, and consumer-based decisions instead of shareholders.",negative
"The bug have been fixed, thank you for the quick response from developer team.",positive
there's something wrong with your app for last few months I can't see answers and too many ads and also your site isn't working too fix Quora.,negative
It was good I liked it there's one reason I gave it four stars cause sometimes it's buggy u guys need to fix the bugs iam so irritated with the bugs :),positive
They killing it slowly. Quora is the wonderful platform for sharing with great people and is mindlessly commercialized. Ads canbe tolerated grudgingly but if you wanted money to see people's Discussions you missing the link. Im removing the Quora not long if it goes like this.,negative

"Been here since a long time ago, kind of disappointed with many things from slow server to terrible new rules",negative
"This app is unreliable on mobile network. Took me 5 minutes until I get to the startup screen to get set up at the start. Also going to the settings also takes time, it looks like it relies to the internet just going to the settings because I want to configure something.",negative
"It's all fun until a lot of people downvote my answers for unknown reason, and my answers becoming more and more unanswered, it's really toxic. Also the app is really slow sometimes crashing.",negative
I believe Quora overall has been a very good online outlet for one seeking truth or understanding. It's one of the very few times I can say something good about a website and this is one of them. I respect the members on there but not all are perfect and neither am I. It's human nature. I believe there are professional people on Quora that know what they are talking about overall.,positive
Too slow. Always heavy to load the home page. You need to make it lightweight!,negative
"It's a good app but there's too much of lagging, whenever I try to write the answers or ask questions the keyboard doesn't appear and hides itself, I'm gonna give it a 3 for now, if this problem finishes then it's gonna be a perfect app (for me) and btw if you wanna earn money from quora space, forget it, they pay us very little money few cents for thousands of views.",negative
"Earlier it was very good, the answer I used to get made sense, but now the website and app appear like display is broken answer merge with each other and the usage experience is also not good. Hope you improve the application and website as well.",negative

I will edit my review if improvements are done. Thank you , Old user of Quora. Edit : improvements are done edited my review to 4 stars.",negative
"The app is stable, reliable, and well made. However code quality is not the issue here. Since you decided to remove one of the best performing answers EVER on quora (which was, incidentally, the only reason I started reading quora) under the B.S. pretense that the answer was somehow 'spam', the quality of both questions and answers on quora has declined. SHARPLY. After years of 'benefit of the doubt'... uninstalled and blocked. It's a damned shame. You ALMOST had something here...",negative
I am sorry to write this review. I'm facing / literally not able to use this app. Because of adds. Adds is fine but content is not readable. This was happening from 6/7 months.

"Quora is something beyond Google. You can find really interesting things which you won't get on google. This Application is great for sharing your views. Actually it is lot more than sharing of views. You can share them, view other's ideas, opine them, put questions, get answers, and much more. I recommend everyone to use this application at least once and experience it.",positive

There's bug in your update. sometimes when writing a comment the written text does not show in the text editor.,negative
I have been using Quora since the early days. It is content rich. Even though the quality of questions have degraded but I am able to find good questions and answers every now and then. I have a feature request- The font size is too small. It hurts my eye. Please provide a control to change the font size as I'm unable to use Quora at length due to smaller fonts.,positive

There is something wrong with this app it gives the the answers twice overlapping each other due to ads you need to fix this up soon as possible,negative
Had a bad experience. Everything in this app takes a lot of time to load. The questions that I search on Google almost never open in the app. The app also continuously shows me the posts from my region which I don't want to see. These posts aren't even related to the topics that I like. Very annoying app. I'd rather have Quora on Chrome.,negative
"It is the best and super fast way to get answers of any problem we are having and I love it. Best way for having advices about all the things but I am having problem, I want to ask question but there aren't enough words' limit for that question can you please increase the limit of words because then we are unable to explain our situation sometimes...",positive

"Super slow, every time I open a question it can stay loading for 20 seconds, and every time I answer a question is the same",negative
Displays only some placeholder graphics instead of text and freezes. I wasn't able to use it not even once. Went through several OS updates since installing it and still nothing.,negative
Overall I found this app to be good. I didn't experience any bugs or errors. I am deleting it however as it takes up too much of my time. The one Star deduction is primarily for the suspicious and scammy looking adds that they allow,positive

The recent update has flawed ‚Äòstats' column. It doesn't filter views by questions and answers. It shows total views which was not the case with the older version.,negative
The app was better earlier but now it's no that much user friendly. It's jammed with too much unuseful content and us slowing down day by day.,negative
Sucks. The answers are great but I can rarely see them. I have great Wi-Fi or network but it never loads. I used the site at first but then everything started glitching,negative

I'm not sure is this the app that's lacking or the Quora forum itself.",negative
"Hated it when I first use them. But things appear to get better and better along the way. Great platform to explore, to teach and to learn.",positive
Quora is a great site. But ur mobile app is so disgusting. Its super slow and unsmooth. I want to use quora more. But i have to use a pc or laptop for that. Which i cant use always. And your mobile app su*ks.,negative
The app should have an option to post images as it makes asking questions or giving opinions a little easier.,neutral

"I have download this app like twice and whenever I try to open it, it doesn't come up. It keep showing a white blank page.",negative
I remember the time when quora was absolutely free and you could access all its content. It was fun reading on quora. Now the times have changed people want to make money. I am very disappointed. But i am thankful too for giving me a good time on quora. But i am not sure if i can say this henceforth.,positive
"Latest update is total garbage. Ads over ads, cut off paragraphs, misplaced pictures. Completely unusable.",negative
It glitches like an old computer. Please fix this. I literally can't use the app or the website,negative
Quora is a good app and i like it a lot but now it has a problem you people has changed the upvote icon to like symbol which is horrific and now i am scared of quora. Please we want upvote back.,negative
"Quora has provided me with several answers on generic questions, but the app has a serious problem that I can't seem to find an answer for. When I do a Google search and tap on a result from Quora, it opens in the app but doesn't take me to the question and answer that was displayed in the search results. Instead it takes me to one of the spaces I'm following and shows a completely irrelevant answer to the question!",negative
I'm a perfect example of this comment. I grew up in a home both my stepmother and father were narcissistic and taught everyone to hate each other. The drama NEVER stopped. everyone still hates each other and I have separated myself from all of them.,negative
"A nice time killer for people who like to read basically anything ranging from educational questions and answers, stories of people funny pictures/memes and more. There are many different categories you can follow so you can read about specific topics you enjoy. It's like Reddit but way more mature and has less garbage on it.",positive
"Used to be a wonderful app back in the day, like in 2015. But now it's just an ad board that requires you to update more often than it ever should.",negative
I had saved few bookmarks however these are no more seen. Not sure if this is standard apps behaviour.,negative
"The real name policy is pretty stupid for multiple reasons, but it's only a minor inconvenience when you can just create new chrome accounts. The worst part about the app, apart from the name policy, is the way it's works with it's website. When you click on a quora link, and choose to open it with your app, it doesn't take you to the specific answer you wanted to see. It takes you to the homepage. That's the biggest inconvenience. If that's fixed it would easily get a 4/5 rating.",negative
I frequently read quora but now suddenly they've started asking to subscribe to read for content.... this isn't really worth it,negative
Quora is a very unique platform that I can easily get lost in for hours. There are abundance of knowledgable and educated people who provide accurate and thorough answers on any subject you can fathom. I have found other users to be mature and respectable even in light of a strong difference of opinions. The not-so-qualified individuals are also pretty easy to spot and avoid. Would have rated 5 stars if not for being forced to log in & create an account in order to access full length answers.,positive
"Earlier I was satisfied with the app but from last few weeks, the app performance has completely decresed. It freezes and same words are repeated over and over. I am just frustrated. I am going for an alternative coz I cant tolerate it anymore.",negative
Showing some ridiculous features when i tap on read more it open the whole page image where as previously it open only read contents and images and i able to scroll more now i need to go back the scroll.,negative
"Quora is definitely an effective and efficient way to gain understanding for questions that bother you but, the start up is slow... Content is seperated or clustered. It's almost impossible to read the beginning of something to the the very end hassle free, pieces of information will just disappear. Please fix this bug.",negative
Good app. Great Place to share Knowledge. But there is one bug. Sometimes answer doesn't loads up at all. Or comments on Answer doesn't loads up. Honestly it ruins my experience. Quora is my second most used platform after YouTube. Kindly fix the bug.,negative
"Although it's getting better than before, it's still heavy, slow and takes a lot of my time to navigate. Web version is better, then.",negative
Is this app dying or what...whenever I try to open an article.It open upeer article than the one I want to read.second Why the hell it take 2 3 pages to open an article..I mean I want to read a whole article it takes me to another page...Then to continue I have to press back to swipe more like wth is wrong with it,negative

"Mobile data is on but show no connection when open quora app. Browsing google, youtube, fb, everything as well but quora is not running. What's the problem?",negative
It is impossible to easily stop emails. Clicking unsubscribe does NOTHING! Still getting emails weeks after Uninstalling. Finally blocked. Let's see if that works.,negative
Its fast and very reliable it helps me get answers that might be a bit difficult to achieve in mater of minutes,positive
Best app get every answer here. I have a suggestion for the app that there should be a community twb where we can post status and also friend options. And also we can create groups,positive
"I've been using Quora since around 2013. Although the quality has generally deteriorated over time, the final straw for me is this platform has been overrun by Chinese-linked groups that will spam tens of thousands of answers and questions that disparage the West (especially the US) and promote Chinese global influence. Quora has had YEARS to adress Chinese government influence but they haven't. This platform lost (or gave up) its integrity long ago. RIP Quora 2013-2017",negative
"I've not been active on this site to much but I think i might try it more often, lol. I l‚ô°ve how a user can ask for advice & actually have kind & helpful people answer you.",positive
"Fabulous, this app is like an encyclopaedia of not only answers to certain questions but also a way to inspire others who have lost their way of living. Best app ever",positive
"Don't waste your time with this app. If you like to hear people express their views on subjects they know nothing about and very bias and one sided views, this is the place for you. Also, they have very extreme left sided views. Your answers are deleted if it doesn't fit their narrative. And your down votes don't register on certain bias questions and answers",negative
It offers invaluable perspectives on things we could never have known...the problem is it takes too much to load information which sucks. I was regular here but nowadays don't use often.,negative
"Haven't been able to login for months (""something went wrong, please try again""), can't access the help center due to perpetually being stuck at a browser check, but still get emails I'm ""subscribed"" to. Attempted to unsubscribe from emails and got an error message every single time. For weeks. Even tried using different computers with no results. What a scummy company for spamming users with no way to unsubscribe. I blocked and reported emails as spam.",negative
My feed is just flickering and nothing able to read write or use options. Its been month and probkem haven't resolved. This is my worst exoerice with quora Utterly dissapointed.,negative
Update the app. The daily message limit is stupid. Just because they don't follow me doesn't mean we have a legitimate discussion in the messages.,negative
"Whenever I open this app or website, i am unable to anything because texts and images are repeated again and again whole thing are mixed. Earlier it was all perfect.",negative
"The support team is horrible, I mailed the around 20 time in this 2 week, but no response came from there.",negative
[Update] - add some type of sorting in bookmark for quick browse for old entries. Still nothing fixed [Old] - Really good for content. Recommendation algorithm need some work. Choosing one different topic will fill every other questions related to that only. And notification is messed. I can't find anything useful in notification option. I recommend re-writing notification with ux in mind.,negative
"It's very slow to start and update was mandatory for use, futher activity are gud on it but processing is very bad to use , irritating one",negative
"App is literally very slow... even I have a decent internet connection still it's interface taking a lot of time to appear infront of me...plzz! Fix this bug. Otherwise app is pretty good and knowledge-based, informative..",negative
"its good in gaining knowledge, through post, answer, question and further more. This app also provide essential , logical and funny info",positive
"There was a time I would have gladly given Quora 5 stars; however, the deluge of insipid questions and the unfair set-up for answers has caused a dip in my Quora enjoyment as of late. Questions that could easily be answered by a simple internet search seem to be a regular occurance...who sings this song, etc. If you can post to Quora, you can look up the answer. Also, I expend a great deal of effort when I answer questions. Yet some of my answers have no views. Really? Seems like favoritism.",negative
One star is only for your app and not the content. The user interface is very bad and it takes tons of time loading up.,negative
This app is useful but it's not working properly.. Multiple contents are coming and stuck in between.. Window have many clashes,negative
"It's a best app for gaining knowledge, but takes a lot of time to open every content.",positive
"Getting harder and harder to keep track of feeds and find the string. Ads and disturbances, and links getting in the way, while copy is cut apart hidden, and isn't contiguous, and other comments can't be tracked back on to pick up where you left off. It's hard to enjoy. It's hard to participate. I'm not tied to anything anymore where I was a common request for certain subjects with a lot of ""likes"" so in my area of expertise is seemed worthwhile to participate and rewarding. Pop ups bad!",negative
"When opening a new topic of question or scrolling down, the app lags. A lot. I don't know what happened to the app or my phone. Hope you can fix it devs. Overall, a really good app to find answers and ask questions.",negative
"Great information hub. Providing answers to life challenging questions. Informative, educative and instructive.",positive
"i totally love it. i read ppl expressing their reviews, & honestly i felt sad for it. fortunately, in india, i never felt any delay in opening up.",positive
"Great for getting facts, advice, or other people's opinions on ANY & ALL topics you can think of! I can get ""lost"" in this app for hours sometimes just reading the Q&A's. Interesting, informative, and useful!",positive
Always something interesting to read and learn. I also find it good to be confronted with opinions that are different to mine. Having an open mind means being able to accept that others see the world differently . Quora has helped me to grow.,positive
Well I love how informative people are. And share knowledge with one another in turn enhancing and empowering one another. It's quite rewarding and fulfilling.,positive
"It has been a long time that i have not used this app because it won't load anything! Despite having a stable internet connection, it still does not open anything.",negative
"It's too laggy, and sometimes it just crashes. And it doesn't respond to my default keyboard very well.",negative
"Everthing's great here! Topics , presentations , ideas.. But it runs a little slow.",positive
Very slow scrolling that means everything is slowly work. You have to fix this problem as soon as possible.,negative
It seems unreliable at times with which we can't save any important topics . Unlike other apps allow us to save our work into desired slots.,negative
"So, l uninstalled my quora on my old phone and on a new phone , l downloaded the Quora app, l was logged into a totally new account, l have been trying all day, but l cannot recover my old app, what do l do, it is getting really frustrating",negative
What he has expressed is absolutely true. One needs to be proud of his own tongue while respecting other languages.,positive
Quora is great app but now a days it has started crashing and takes more time to load content.,negative
"Great app.. you get to read n number of experiences.. people post their confessions, story, success, failures etc by which you can gain experience.. here I find most of the answer I have been looking for with vast variety.. this has helped me alot in many ways.",positive

"App was really good but for some days it is loading and starting very slow and it kind of freez when i read more , please do something or i have to move to other apo",negative
After the update many bugs were fixed or has been reduced.Good jobüëçüèº But still it took So much data to load. Does this app has a data saver mode?? I couldn't find it üôÉ,positive
"Love it. Ask anything, you get answered, by both amateurs/laymen and pros. Verified info's and non verified come up to respond to or answer one's queries. Just let the question length in letters be lengthened so we can type every question or inquiry or query more detailed and all covered. Thanks for helping me few times all this while.",positive
There isn't any denying that this app is really good but it's a bit slow. sometimes it takes too much time to open any page even though internet speed is good.,negative
"My most visited app for quite sometime now. Quora has content I resonate with, the phenomenal amount of support from such a purpose driven & diverse community of bloggers, readers, on lookers...curious strangers who just need to feel connected.",positive
Some people may be willing to pay to view content but there should be an advertising option like any other major content provider on the internet today.,neutral
"I have actually grown a small love for this app. I use it a lot and answer people's questions and ask rarely a few of my own. It is awesome to just read other people's questions and just help them out if they need it. A great app if you need to know something, just search up the question and you should get it. Really recommend it. Use it a lot nowadays.",positive
"I love reading on Quora but recent updates made it hard to follow up the feed, complete content comes distorted. No alignment, everything looks broken. Not sure if this is only on my device or others. I had removed Quora couple of months back due to same issues. Thought it would have been fixed now, but it still has the same issue. Please fix it",negative
Asking simple questions leads to heavy harassment but instead of weeding out cranky a-holes you flag normal questions because your teams to lazy to take real action and see it violates not a single thing. But I guess it's easier to flag everything so you don't have to do a job.,negative
This is an opportunity for me. I'm sharing my ideas and ask some questions. Most of professionals send me answers according to my questions. Literary it's an Energy for my self improvement.,positive
Old quora was so good. What's with this Like instead of Up vote. Earlier theme was so good. Please do some research and get back to how it was before like awesome.,positive
"I first download this app. Then uninstalled due to storage but now in Google too iam unable to use quora. Bug problem. Pls fix that problem. Edi: pls fix that problem as soon as possible. I had already report that bug through the required website. But, no improvement. Pls fix that. I'll edit my review in positive way after that problem solved.",negative
Do something about the software of this app. It consumes too much battery. I have to surf online to find an answer on Quora. Please improve it. Otherwise the app is great to find any information.,negative
Who thought it was gonna be a good idea to censor people's answers and make them pay a subscription for it? Why would you do that to random people's answers? This is supposed to be a app for answering questions not forcing money out of people by making them pay to see other people's answers. Especially if there's a chance it's not even the right answer. Yeah ads are acceptable anyone can tolerate ads but straight up blocking you from seeing people's answers for a subscription is just messed up.,negative
"I've reported many times to Quora that my comments under posts are not showing up at all and notifications have not been sent out. Quora wrote back each time I reported the issue and they would say that they are ""looking into the issue""...but it's been months later and the problem has not been fixed! I've even tried creating a new quora account, used a different browser, different device, desktop version and app version..but I encounter the same problem: my comments are not appearing under posts",negative
Keeps crashing everytime i tried to read. Frustrating and upsetting.,negative
The app crashes a lot. Half of the screen are not visible only. Uninstalling right away.,negative

Great app. This is useful for my studies. I have only one request. please give us an option to add photos while asking questions.,positive
"Awesome app. But it's weird on mobile. There are things that are confusing and are mixed up and such, there are buttons that are at places no one would think about and not where they should be. Fir example adding an attachment or even replying to a comment",negative
"Great, mature, intellectual people for great stories tailored to your interests. I also like the questions asked and your own questions, which are answered quickly. Glad it popped up in my email. üòÄ",positive
Great app but the UI overlay needs to be simplified. One just gets so confused by just looking at all the buttons.,negative
"I think, this app is wonderful app for learners. Here you can read others views, or their ideas. Also Here you will get alot of basic nd useful English material, which you can use those words or sentences in you writing and speaking. Thank you üòä",positive
"Used to love the app. But when I was asked to pay to read someone's answer to a question about a cartoon, I Uninstalled it.

"riddled with bugs. highly unpleasant experience. possible the worst performing app installed on my device. do not recommend if you aren't interested in challenging yourself with painful prolonged headaches. needs to be revamped or euthanized, it's that bad.",negative
"The phone heats up everytime when using this application. And now Quora has started charging money. Will delete the application soon. It's unaffordable in India, where even owning an iPhone is a dream for many.",negative
I love this media as it has a lot of learning and teaching value! Useful instead of pointless drama!! Although I'm not a fan of the new purchase option that blocks some posts.,positive
"Aap is not working propery, it has a lot of glitch it shows half paragrah max. time and also show repeated para many times, i have not a gud experience with quora, humble request to improve this problem...",negative
This app has changed drastically. Earlier my usage of this app was more than all the social media combined. Now whenever I open the website or it's app it glitches and all the images or words are repeated and I can't even stay for 10 seconds. Please do something,negative
"The ads are disruptive, but the concept of asking a question and being able to compare answers from people who also may have had the same experience is very helpful. My only gripe is it's hard to find the beginning of it where you can ad Ask your question. This is a worthwile App.",positive
"Got blocked form posting .l asked one simple question related to well being, but I missundersood the format reqirements.simple error. I Was new user, over zelous moderators, come on guys read like 100+ questions and answers in your mails. I did not even realise I was blocked from posting till 9 month later. No notification given. No way to ask forgivnes no support.. first post. Won't touch it again. Not recommened at all. Would get zero stars but have to put one.",negative
Great app with its contents. You get clarity for so many things and people who are ready to give answers no matter how ridiculous the questions sounds sometimes. All these for free. I love it. I could've gotten scammed few years ago if I didn't read some of the questions on Quora.,positive
awesome application to share knowledge and to know the answer of questions that arises in the mind. üòÖüòÖ you should also give money to the people who answer the questions similar to you tubeüòÅüòÅüòú. Set some criteria for that your application will boom like anything boom boom? i always enjoy QUORA.,positive
The app has become slow and is almost impossible to find what you came for with unnecessary trump pictures all over the place. Please fix it!,negative
"Disappointed. It used to be a wonderful platform earlier, but the advertisements and Quora+ compulsion for few answers is totally killing the essence of the application.",negative
"I've been going to the web for answers to questions many times a day, but I fell in love with Quora when I asked this question. People sometimes say that ""matter and energy are interchangeable"". I thought, ""Really? I don't see any people making things with nothing but energy. I need an example or that saying is bogus. There were theoretical answers, ho hum. Then this guy from a collider wrote of what he's seen and it blew my mind. The thread itself has the brightest minds on Earth contributing.",positive
"App does not work!! Lately the quora app is not working, it doesn't even load properly. Please do check this issue! Its a great and useful website, its very unfortunate that this major app bug issue is not getting fixed.",negative
"Very good application for gaining & sharing knowledge but site is so slow than FB or insta ,it takes time to load while scrolling even if you have good connection..",negative
Previously quora was good but its irritating old version was far better thn the updated one anyways i have uninstalled ut just bcz of pop up ads bugs and glitches wat ever it is i hate it,negative
The app itself is fine. The people who awnser your question can be nice but I find I get attacked and harrassed more than I have pleasant conversations. If you want a nice community then you have to look really hard for one. I've uninstalled the app muiltiple times not wanting to see what people comment. Every time I see a qoura notification I get extremely anxious and scared. Be careful EDIT: everything you ask will be seen as trolling and moderation is useless. you will be harrassed daily,negative
"App has problem of running slow for keyboard input, which makes it unusable. Letters get missed, along with capitalization. Does not auto rotate screen (Samsung Tab S5e), so can only use in portrait mode. I uninstalled it and am now reinstalling, so will see if any better. It wasn't! Am currently using latest Android upgrade on Huawei Honor 7, and some pictures show blank, including the adverts. Having also tried to use the app on my OnePlus Nord under Android, that doesn't work properly either.",negative
Hands down- the Slowest app on playstore... Never ending cycle of updating 'for faster version'.. P. S updated 2021,negative
"Signup failed as it kept stating the names I was choosing were ""restricted"" even after adding random ltrs & #'s to them, but then it would allow them on the 3rd or 4th attempt. Then after inputting the validation code from their email it again blocked me by requiring 7 recaptcha's in a row before it said I had Failed, closed the window, and sent me back to where I first started. Overall it was a complete waste of time, and i hope for Quora's sake it was a computer glitch as they can do better..",negative
"What I love about Quora the most is the fact that I can answer many types of question. I also discover new things even while looking for questions to answer, and as a person who loves writing down their opinions on many topics, Quora satisfy me. The only problem with this app is how laggy it is, which often ruins my mood while using the app. It gets laggy all the time; when you're typing or entering new tabs. It also loads at a slow pace. Please fix this, thank you.",positive
"More educational stuff. New trends in the world and good, highly qualified people are on telegram for good reasons they feed us good news and information.",positive

Very interesting and educational. Enjoy learning alot about so many different subjects.,positive

Worst app i have seen in my life. Build quality is poor. There's a lot of bugs. App crashes aal the time,negative

It confuses me because I'll see a question that I'm interested in knowing the answer too as well but when I click on the app 9r notification it takes me to the app but it's different questions all together.

"Quora deserves more than the 3 stars I gave, but it is broken since the last update. I cannot read anything on my feed, it keeps laying images over text and repeating the particular story down the feed. I have tried re-installing the app. but it is still not working. Hope you fix it soon. *Really sorry about this, my phone was the problem. Quora is just the place to be.",negative
"Very bad app. Words are often blocked by images or fragments of images, the pages only partly load, and sometimes jump around so you barely read them.",negative
"If you really want to get user credentials, make it clearer what you are actually asking for and know what credentials are available and valid globally, not simply rejecting true answers that you don't have knowledge about!",neutral

"You know I just downloaded the app for the first time 2min ago witch I would think your app knows that. I was on it for 5min before I downloaded it, so it doesn't make any since to ask me to rate this app when besides the 5min before I downloaded it I've never used or even heard of it before till about 15min ago, it just makes no sence??...

Y'all suck I got an email part of a story wanted to read it and then I installed the app and then it wanted me to pay money to read it so I'm uninstalling it now....,negative
"I really enjoy the breadth of questions, and the experience of many different viewpoints. It's satisfying to contribute and share knowledge gained over a lifetime, to offer some guidance to the less experienced or those who can use encouragement. However I'm not happy that people can now isolate my answers behind a paywall. I will delete shared answers then republish after blocking sharers. I give my time and contribution free + will keep that control. Quora needs to do better here.",positive
Include a history tab...for the articles that I read throughout the day...or If I have to leave something in between...I can get back to it later sometime. The app seems to load slower as well.,neutral

"As a member, I really liked the content of Quora. The app is easy to navigate. Questions got legitimate answers except for some. Sometimes, on questions that need citations on answers, the answers have none. Moreover, the content of this app is not safe with being ripped off by another user (in guise of translating the content but actually stealing it). Please do something with your data privacy and content security.",positive
Love this site..so much information on all subjects to learn from or help with many other issues on scams to dealing with narcisstic personalities...a must have to meet..learn and grow smarter in interaction with others in your journey.,positive

"I didn't have any strong feelings about Quora until trying to use it for the first time today. Strong arming users into signing in and handing over data like emails and Facebook info that you will use to target me for making money is the reason I now do not trust the site or the ethics of the people running it. I'm no longer neutral. This website is being run into the ground by people with no scruples. When the company fails they won't understand why the ship sank, but it was their doing.",negative
This app would be great if they made major improvement on their UI . It's a nightmare having to navigate through it.,positive
"The app is so sluggish and laggy. Using the website is way better. Quora itself is great, but the app is useless.",negative
Updated the app. Its been one month and it sucks. Does not load and when it does it shows anwers and images in crazy jumbled way.,negative
"I want to give 1 star, I really don't understand why has quora deleted my answer. It was not a spam nor advertising for self interest... It was purely an knowledge based post about learning flute.. I need my answers right now.. I want helpline support contact info right now.. It was so shameful on quora for not being so professional..",negative
"I'm trying to delete my account on the phone and as soon as I delete it, it again gets logged in automatically. Solve the issue.",negative
"The Quora app developers are too lazy to develop a mode for millions of tablet users. So we're stuck using a rediculous narrow strip with blank space taking up 80% of the screen. Since I mostly consume social media on a tablet, I will avoid Quora and use more evolved social platforms.",negative
"Quora as a question-answer site is pretty decent. When they started monetizing really good answers disappeared. You have to tap on a question three times to see a list of ""all"" answers to that question. Along with other eccentricities of the app like how the answer editor works I've decided to uninstall Quora app. Prefering a web brower instead.",negative
The application is good but lacks on the performance aspect. The loading of pictures is extremely slow.,negative
Don't use this app it is unsecured it's already packed into my Google account and I had to change my email and my Google account had to be redone don't even attempt in other words it's been unfair find my Google it is garbage üóëÔ∏è,negative
"I found the application to be more of an empty platform and therefore wholly unhelpful in encouraging people needing help, to seek a relationship with Jesus Christ. The app placed so much emphasis upon having ""credentials"" proving credibility, I was unable to help those crying out for help.",negative
For the past 2 days the app is not working properly the full question and digest are not being shown.,negative
"a platform to meet like minded individuals. I would add nothing to it, its just perfect!",positive
I used to love quora but it became a money grabbing site like everything else. People post sex stories and ontop of that for genuine answers that would be helpful they charge you to read them because they're made by a professional and its dumb It used to be a free site. I'm gonna move to a new site. Trashy. Plus there's mainly memes and ads.,negative
"I deleted this app, after browsing and writing for several years, because of their new monetization strategy. Quora was, and for the most part still is, a wonderful tool in assisting the spread of useful knowledge to both professionals and laymen in nearly any subject. However, many of the 'best' creators are now locked behind paywalls, and I find my once-undying confidence in its utility to be blemished, and my trust in their commitment to education diminished. I hope they revise this system.",negative
Quora is a good teacher and a mom to teach me lot of stuff. I have learnt a lot of stuff.,positive

Awsome for asking questions to people with a ton of experence and a great place to connect overall. I recommend everyone give it a try,positive
"Love everything about Quora. I have an android phone and the I would give it 5 stars if only the little up and down arrow on right hand side of screen is in the absolute worse spot when reading something and slowly scrolling. If you accidentally touch it, it either goes quickly to the very top or very bottom and really ruins the Quora experience for me. Until this is rectified I will only give 4 stars.",positive

App not running. Have reinstalled it twice. Comes up with problem screen. Not happy.,negative
I like the concept behind it. But there are a few things that are so irritating especially the app itself as it takes so long and multiple attempts to load/ open. Many topics being discussed are really perverted,negative

I'm happy I found this platform. I haven't communicated much over the past 2 years and this has helped me remember that there are people out there that I can connect with through this digest. thank you!!,positive
A very wonderful platform for information about almost every of life's aspect. I am learning a lot through it.,positive
"I don't know yet. but that's kind of obvious, after one minute it's hard to have an opinion. yes I could have pushed the ""ask me later"", but I didn't, because I've done it so many times, and it seems to me that if it's important for the app developers to get an opinion perhaps more attention to the fact that.., well ask me on Quora about this subject for a more in depth answer. some applications ask for this after you share a say product, after every single share. it's slightly annoying. truth.",negative
Loads very slow. Everytime I open the app takes more than 2 mins for the content to load.,negative

Highly appreciated ü§ó to a phantom who introduced me this app. Very useful and beautiful designed app. Helpful for every field one.,positive
"I rated it earlier, but of course the review vanished. The content is most diverting, and often quite fascinating! Eventually one wishes to pose a question when no one else seems to have asked it. I found no link to do this, save possibly the ""Post a Message"" one; however it asks for a name -- of whom? Someone I think knows the answer? There seems to exist no link to a ""Help"" app either. I do not find any loading problems as mentioned in other reviews, though. I can read questions but not ask.",positive

AWFUL JUST FOR ONE REASON. I'm trying to delete my acc and every time I even open a goddamn answer it automatically logs me back in EVENTHOUGH I TURNED OFF THE AUTO UNLOCK feature. The reason I had to delete my acc in the first place is bcus it's publicly visible to anyone who googles my name and my name remains the same even though I changed it in quora. A HUGE PRIVACY RISK. pls rectify this. Basically what I need is an option to permanently delete my acc in just a day and NOT 14 WHOLE DAYS!,negative

so so bad. so glitchy. so many errors. you have to do so much fixing in the app and also in the site. disappointing.,negative

"One of the worst user interfaces I've seen in a while. There is always something that looks like a comment, but isn't. Either a box telling you recommended topics to follow, or a box showing what other users are asking, which is the same as a question, but now with a quick reply option? Sometimes I'll get boxes informing me of the top 100 questions for other categories of questions, for absolutely no reason. Or an ad. Stop cluttering your UI. Just show me questions, and show me answers.",negative
"I've been using this app for 2 years and this is a great app for asking question and get the good answers, but sometimes as someone who need others' opinion on something, kinda sensitive topic and want to ask as anonymous but the fitur is not available anymore, it will be so helpful if the fitur is still exist.",positive

I agree with the devil not being omnipresent. I actually have a video of what I believe is a Fallen Angel because of things I've been going through physically and observed. I have video of an unknown being (head w/no body) darting around the room watching me and I also hear it call my name. I have to slow the video down 8x the speed then again by half that speed to be able to track it. it looks just like camera noise at regular speed. it's so fast there are multiple copies of it moving about.,neutral

An astonishing app. It was the best app for learning.but there are some annoying bugs out there.

"Quora has a wide range of responses to questions which are quite interesting and humorous depending on who asks or answers the questions.What I like about the questions and answers are that they are not totally text book,full of originality.The outrageous facts,sad and personal stories,eloquent explanations and blunt coarse responses or questions make it very real and addictive.Like a magazine,chatshow and encyclopedia all in one. Connection variable or slow to load at times.Update PC smartphone",positive

"Quora is good app for learners, teachers and actually it is good for all those who are passionated to learn something.

"Deleted Account and Disable in All Languages. So much irritating while using.

It not a video content app, don't download it..no use.",negative
"The app is terrible now, there are white spots hiding the content and making it unable to read even a single answer well. So annoying.",negative
Alot of good conversation and advice that comes from all kinds of different peaple and alot of groups you can join on a given subject or start your own really recommend this app,positive
"I loved to use Quora a lot, but now a days I found a lot of memes and images in the feed instead of good readable contents. Its irritating and which is reduced quality of Quora. I hope Quora would received this issue earlier. If I need to see memes then there is another social media platforms available I don't need this.",negative
didn't think I was going to like this app it took me a minute to understand it but hey this is a pretty good app because whatever you can't understand in life does somebody there to give you an opinion to you can view it in a different angle which is good A lot of people can't handle other angles they can't even handle everyday life or the past no no this is a great app,positive
"very very excellent site I actually met a very very good guy on this site who I could go to for advice and help with stuff when I cannot get ahold of my regular parole officer in the City of Buffalo, I could reach out to John and usually gets back to pretty quick and it's always straight-to-the-point does not beat around the bush and gives it to you straight! not like other people that want to tell you what you just want to hear this gentleman is down-to-earth and open the most questions.

The problem occurs both in the app and the website.",negative
"After I updated the app, contents now blur and overlap into one another. Uninstalling an re-installation has failed to resolve the issue.",negative

this is a great application but the UI could have some changes to make it more user friendly!,positive
Where have you been all these years. A proper platform and one that hasn't slipped into insanity based on questions and answers. Best forum I have posted on. Some much to learn and a bit to pass on.,positive

Just tell me, are you gonna fix this or not ???? This app is already so frustrating !! Ever since I downloaded this app, it hasn't worked properly for me. I'm so disappointed with this app !!!!! üò§üòë I wish I could write this without giving any stars. It doesn't deserve..not even a single one. FIX THIS APP ASAP,WILL U?",negative
"That pointless intrusive ""there's more to read in your feed"" message won't go away and it's blocking stuff I actually WANT to read. I came to the app just for a question I found in google. I don't give a _______ about my 'quora feed'!",negative
"Very nice and informative app to use ....not a normal social media app but an app for the educated group of people who can come and share their experiences , suggestions for people and not only that ask questions and answer them as well ..",positive
The app is absolutely horrible.May be the worst of all social media apps.It's too slow and full of glitches.Most of the time the pictures and comments don't load properly.Sometimes an answer opens only after clicking multiple times on it.The 'Add Qustion' or '+' sing in the bottom left corner has a peculiar position and it often disrupts my scrolling.The updates brings absolutely nothing new into the table and problems remain same.,negative
"There is something really wrong with the application. I click something, and something else opens. It's very frustrating.",negative
"As I said before, they allow ultimate even sex erotic in this channel. But if you say anything against Chinese President, or China it will get censored. This has been happening with many US apps incluing YouTube recent times. We need to find out and solve why this is happening. This is serious security issue into nations also. Why ? Because that country bans free speech and even these platforms. But still these platforms block anything like these.",negative
Previous version was best. This is the worst version as we are not getting true number of veiws of the contents. Pl reset to previous version.,negative
TOO many ADS üò°üò°üò° Like ads weren't enough now i have to pay for unlocking some answers COME ON how much revenue you wanna generate..,negative
"Unable to use Quora. Ever since when I made an account with Quora (maybe ever since years ago) I was unable to do any activities with my Quora account along with not sending any comments, unable to like and share, unable to post what I want, and more goes on. Ever since my account creation, all of my actions and activities were blocked and I'm unsure why since I barely didn't do anything to break the rules. This time, I don't want further support anymore about this.",negative
"Mostly a positive experience. But like all things that start as good ideas, the detractors and voices of hate have tried to wreck the good.",negative
"No longer enjoyable. Quora has become buggy, slow, and full of repetitive titles and posts.",negative
"Irritating popups, banners and the content is also not good. For a while now my feed has been filled with memes and images, and the maximum of them are adult in nature. Also some people seem to see Quora as their personal blog. Sometimes the questions posted have literally have no merit whatsoever, for eg : ""What did you do this morning?"". I hate what Quora has become.",negative
"very bad app , forcing me to buy ads free or they will not allow me to read the article that I have saved long time back",negative
It's a very good app for accessing Quora and it now loads incredibly fast. Keep on the good work.,positive

"Everytime i swipe don,t looking for a article this app does show words properly world's are moving even if i am not swiping the phone This app is trash",negative
Quora is fantastic. It's been offering some of the best anecdotal information since the monetization of the internet. The app does a great job of what the website does.,positive
I can spend an hour writing an answer and have it disappear in a second with one wrong touch and spend an hour trying to retrieve it and fail.,negative
An okay app I believe it has way too many ads and it's annoying how you have to put in your email every single time even though you say remember email or remember me,negative
Handy handy handy no matter what it is that I need to know I can always find out here. And there's almost always a prompt response and no waiting. The information you get is also verifiable and accurate!,positive
"One of the best apps that clears all of your doubts, you can see 10000+ motivational posts etc...",positive
good app but no proper tutorial of how to use it. Had to figure out things myself. So took a little time to get normal with it Edit: this app has some serious network issue. It runs with wifi but not phone data. From Bangladesh,negative
Too much of lag with white surface appear after doing anything in this app and avoid false information,negative
The recent update has solved the glitch problem and is now clear to read and use. Thank you.,positive

"Constantly spamming notifications. There are so many settings in push notifications that I don't even know which one is spamming me all day, like they deliberately make it harder for you to turn them off. Horrible user experience",negative
"Clicky, like Reddit. I'm to old to appreciate the new rules and to fragile and scared to make posts in apps. that I don't get approved, thumbed down, disliked, or downgraded. Great coding but not my thing.",negative
"I read this stuff on Quora about narcissistic behavior and it makes me feel less crazy. People actually deal with the same things I have had to deal with. The emotional abuse is so much worse then any physical abuse. He has been gone for a year but, it feels like yesterday and oddly I miss him so much.",negative
"It's so badly layed out and so laggy on the web, I suggest you guys switch to Reddit a it is basically the same, just a tiny bit more clear and less lag",negative
"The ""app"" itself is good, in terms of UI etx. What I don't like is the fact that anyone can answer your questions even if they don't have expertise. You might encounter mockery, insults even if your question is valid and all you are seeking is help. It is no different from FB or Twitter. My recommendation: DON'T SEEK ANSWERS FROM STRANGERS WHO AREN'T EXPERTS. INSTEAD, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, READ BOOKS, WHITE PAPERS, JOURNAL PUBLICATIONS, NEWS. Etc. OR talk to an actual expert on the subject.",negative
It is good in terms of information but it is very slow. In my opinion if this app have fast speed in use like Twitter it will become world no1 app soon. Do something for this(slow speed) problem.,neutral
"My God, the app is so slow. How? After all these years, this issue still persist? Please hire some better developer and fix this, thank you.",negative
I liked this app quite but recently they started to charge for the answers and that's where they lost me. Aren't the ads enough for you revenue......,negative
"I just downloaded this app and was hoping and looking forward and expecting a perfect experience but I am experiencing glitches I can't type it takes hours to load, it takes ages for a page to load and even to make selections of topics takes miles before it can open, what could be the problem?",negative
"The Quora medium generally is best with their ideas and all, but the app is somewhat slow and takes time to log on and display fields on android. Would be glad if that can be fixed, didn't affect the 5-star ratings tho. Good job üëç",positive
I noticed on the Update that on Galaxy S9 the app is freezing when I respond to questions BEFORE I am finished with my Answer . The App keeps freezing during any pause in my typing and I must : POST the answer as is THEN edit it and continue . This is a pain to type this way. No other App does this . The update still does. Fix it please . I do not have time for this.,negative
Worst app ever! The post button isn't working.. my long answer has been cleared and not even saved as draft. Idk what the hell is wrong with this app,negative
I updated the app and it became unusable...takes forever to load Edit: It has been resolved and deserves a 5 star!!!,negative
"Quora almost help me when i have questions, overall quora is best place to find information and advice. But i have one suggestion, can you make the subscription alternatives payment? Likes google pay credit, merchant, etc. But for me the most easy way is google pay credit. I'm Indonesian, i don't have credit/debit card, it's hard for me to afford that. Please make your payment methods get easy.",positive
It is very helpful for me to get knowledge from many subjects . And also I am improving my English with this app and I am also suggested to each student that they can spend their time to read Quora from different topics. Thanks üòä.,positive
"Ever since my phone had an update a week or so ago, whenever I try to type a comment or rebuttal I get a paragraph or a few sentences in and then ""blink"" it's all gone and I have to start typing from the beginning. There are times when a short sentence comment takes me 13 tries to get it out. This is the only app that I'm having trouble with, and it pisses me off. Up till the update I didn't have any problems, I'd blame the phone if it happened to other apps but only here on Quora",negative
This is not good. Please Improve it. That's tooooooo slow to use. My internet is not slow but your app is.üôÇ I hope you will do something about this.,negative
"It's a stupid app. Always asking endless stupid questions like do I speak a language, why did I close a certain ad. How about you give us some breathing space. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé Worst app I've ever used",negative
"Man this is good and i also get precise and apropreat answers too , but man the problem is the lots bugs in it fix it , Very slow fix it, improve algorithms too man sometimes sometimes different things pop-outü§£ and and improve it a bit and put some more options in some areas and stricks to the adult content droppers if it is ok then you should have a age restriction criteria otherwise it is a good software model man like Facebook and telegram good just need a bit important oküëç best of luck",positive
I really enjoy the stories and the news you have on here you present them well. Thank you.,positive
"I was a avid user of both, the app, and website but to be honest I think your website is far better than this app. At least it does not opens a new tab when clicked on 'read more' option. It kills my excitement to scroll down. Please solve this issue. Till then I think I'll using you website. Thanks.",positive
great platform for acquiring information. both academically and entertainment. it really answered a lot of questions i had and i recommend this to everyone with a curious mind.,positive
"Actually this is a great app untill you found out that it's taking toooooooo long to load, changing your settings, write your opinion, etc. Even sometimes the app suddenly force closed when I still read the posts peacefully and it's really annoying, for sure. Please mind the user experiences and suggestions. Hope soon will be another great improvement from this app. Thanks",negative
App is too slow with bugs and glitches. Other than that everything's great.,negative
"This rate is solely because of the amount of e-mails I receive, even though I always click on ""unsubscribe"" and it confirms [that I have unsusbcribed]. Honestly, this is horrible and makes me wish I had never created an account on Quora in the first place.",negative
It used to be great. Right now it's filled with grossly inaccurate answers on about everything. I got the filling that it's being used by some people and even some countries for propaganda purposes.,negative
Although Quora is informative and fun to use. The app just takes too much time for simple things to load. Please fix it and I will try again.,negative
"This app is very great however I tried posting pictures on my answers but it doesn't work and there's an error that pops up, other people also experience the same thing I hope it could get fixed",negative
"It's a bit laggy. I'd comment on a post in a space but when I hit post it'd stay up as if I'm still writing. When u hit post again, it'd say there's already a pending response but it won't show up under the person I was answering.",negative
"People who are working with user interface, please fix that and make a smooth experience for users, the content what Quora provides is awesome but the user interface is very bad, it always feels laggy",negative
Nice app that is very useful for one that has interest in learning different fields in the easiest ways,positive
"quora is a red app but it's function is very most helpful for sudents and other field workers, it is ocean of gain knowledge and many posted by the popular engineer and teachers, so I say one of the best app for every students and other field worker",positive

Good Concept and Informative for all. But it is very slow and unable to use. Nowadays it doesn't show anything just loading. Very Slow. Fix the issue.,negative
Orvilles can be confusing. This article provides a good overview and for me clarified a few mysteries!,positive
"It's amazing platform in each and every sense. If you're interested in knowing about anything, any country, any nation, you can simply ask here on Quora and you will get answers. Great grand application üòä",positive
"I highly DON'T recommend this app or site. All they do is try to shove content on your face all the time. You rarely get any useful info, even if you find it, they make it difficult to read with all their garbage recommendations. STAY AWAY from it. Reddit is far far better.",negative
"None of the people in the screenshots use the app anymore, and that's a sign of where the company is going. I used Quora for about 8 years, and have now deleted it. There simply are no good writers anymore. Every feature that I once liked- real writers, diverse experiences, high quality content being promoted is gone. Even the UI has deteriorated, the main feed struggles to load once you scroll for 5- 10 mins. Quora team seems to be clueless on why their users liked being on their website.",negative
My experience to Quora is that one could post a subject about something that could help humanity something that could get interjections and that was exactly what I'm looking for where people can see what I say and answer and even respond in a way of helping that is the great news of this app pay attention to where I'll be talking about and you'll see God..,positive
This app is extremely buggy. Too much to write. Just scrap the whole thing and start anew...,negative
Not able to upload JPEG files as answer in the app. Thanks for replying Just did that.,neutral
I haven't used you much it was referred to me in some mysterious way it's uniquely different I don't like fumbling around on new apps too much cuz it's still have a lot to learn on old ones,neutral
I uninstalled this app. I tried several times answering questions and each time the app claimed they were published and even gave me an error message when I tried to publish them from the draft section which I saw them in later. After trying to use this for about a day I uninstalled because it seemed that nothing I had tried to post or answer actually did. I just went for the quora website instead which has no problems running.,negative
"Complicated and not user friendly, but the resources are phenomenal! I am very impressed with Quora. I have answered a lot of questions, and it's awesome to be able to provide the truth in this ""cancel culture"" that we live in. it's quite humorous to see some of the questions that people post. I don't know if they do it with sincerity or just a fool around, but let me tell you, some of these questions are like wow. I also think it's important that we are sensitive to people's needs,",positive
"When I open the app after looking something up, it will just be a blank gray space and I can't navigate anything and it will restart any writing I did. It's very frustrating.",negative
It really should be required that second language be introduced early in a child's school life. They would probably become more proficient at both languages.,positive
the app is poorly optimised üëéüëé and i wanted to search a post because it got refreshed and wasn't able to find it the search option isn't helpful at all ‚òπÔ∏è. And it keeps buffering even youtube was working but not quoraüòÜ. And don't even talk about quora +. And the app keeps crashing come on man!üò©. it would have been good feature to a history option to see which questions i have visited üôÇ. Please guysss!! fix ittt!üôÇ,negative
(I hope this app stunk because I couldn't figure something out) I'd try to ask a question or answer a question and I couldn't. It made no sense as to why I'd be following a person and reading their stories and see many replies but I'd type out my reply and not allowed. I gave up pretty quick after a few weeks because I'd have insight to answer a question or want to help and not allowed. It's kinda the whole purpose of the app ‚ô°,negative
"Used to be great, not very usable now. Hundreds of unqualified people just copypasting generic answers from somewhere or telling mullti-page stories to answer a simple question.",negative
Best app i ever seen good for asking questions and getting answer and also for getting information and also interacting with different people from different part of the world i will recommend any to get this appüòÅ,positive

The app Very useful. But there one problem is the app not working properly and app has been so many Bug.,negative
Perfect! Same experience. Haven't smoked in over 10 years. I tried EVERYTHING to quit. Vaping is only thing that worked.,positive
Such a pathetic slow app. Freezes most of the time. Articles load slow even when someone is having a fast wifi connection. And top of that these morons have audacity to introduce quora plus. First fix your app then think to make money. Stupid developer.,negative
"The app used to be good. But now I barely get any content related to my interests, it's just non stop spamming of politically correct bs and celebrity news. Deleted",negative
"Great app, provide its mean in the first place, but needs a different UI to increase user experience.",positive
Too much annoying bug is full of this app. The app is freeze when I tap on something. I even can't read any post. Plz fix it otherwise shut down the service. That's it,negative
"sure it's a great app, but it keeps spamming me emails even tho I already set the email preference to never send me any emails. Really irritating pls fix this Quora.",negative
"Edited my 4 stars rating to 2 stars. The app has terribly slowed down with latest update. 1) While writing a post, cursor vanishes when you copy /paste something. I have to save it as draft amd reopen the draft again to continue writing. 2) Unable to post an answer since last 3 days. Error say ""Something went wrong... Try again"". Have tried multiple times and have already reported bug at Quora. However did't get a hearback. Now it's becoming really hard to write here.",negative
"you told this reality because the IT and computer engineers work in company as per their requirement. so in many cases the work is not as per engineers syllabus, the same work can be done by BCA, MCA, Bsc students in lesser salary than IT Engineer and had got degree in lesser fees than IT Engineer. This your guidance is excellent and supporting., regards,",neutral
"Amazing! I love this app honestly, got a lot of answers to my questions and I answered others questions. Super easy to go through, set up account, etc. But I rate it a 4 star cause of how slow it can get. Like when you click a post it takes 29 seconds to load up. Another bug is when you click a post and it opens the one like 5 things above it . Other then that 11/10 app. I recommend you get it if you need anything",positive
"The stories are what make quora great, the app only needs to not-interfere with the ease of use. And it does just that. Fast response, clean design, all good!",positive
The formatting is horrible and illegible on Vivo 1820. I have stopped using this app because of this issue.,negative
best for students and everyone who needs right information from experience and knowledge person.üëç,positive
Absolute horrid slow app site that is the most impossible to use. Very slow and frustrating. I timed how long it took to look at one question's answers. First it took 3 minutes to just get to the page. Two more minutes to get to the question. Then suddenly it leaped into the next query. Great. This site is fine if only you put some effort into dealing with the app's flaws. Please I'm begging you on behalf of everyone who has been waiting for years to just read the article. Fix this app now!,negative
"It is not that nice app. Everyone just vote their team in comparison and sometimes they go so deep while saying bad about someone that it could hurt directly into the heart. Even it is like a music band someone is saying bad about Imagine dragons or about BTS or about Maroon 5. First they should show that that they can do easily or better not to speak. Its not nice app but the people who use are using it as a fun, they don't think that it will show on Google. If could then would give Zero starüëé",negative
Can't work properly in my phone- both website and app. Texts do not display in sequence. There must be some bugs issue. Will download again when that is fixed.,negative
"Alot to navigate. I'm new here however Quora has much to offer on advice, how to and helpful solutions to whatever your going thru. It feels like people really want to sincerely help you; most answer you with kindness. Haven't had any issues. Keep up the great work !",positive
very insightful and very useful information I would definitely recommend this app to everyone has something for anyone wanting good advice and responses,positive
"I have written so many responses since 2014 and has never disappointed me! I'm glad to say that this app is worth the time and effort.. ESPECIALLY if you are a writer! Now with the addition of getting paid for your answers it is even better! So, I'd highly recommend this app to anyone who just likes to write, read or present opinions to the public that can both help them and help you get clarity about your writing skills.",positive
"Too addictive, promots mostly the posts with gossip or clickbait titles. Amoled theme is also not available.",negative
I would like it better if you could commit on things because it is not always accurate on the topic especially about the birds. I raise several types so I know.,neutral
i rely on Quora to remind y going back to my ex would be the worst decision i could ever make. It helps to recognize other narcissists so i don't go thru what ive already been thru. and its a support system,negative
"It's very interesting, although obscure. It definitely catches my attention. Not sure how ""good"" the news or social info is, but definitely sidetracks me.",positive
Sometimes while clicking on a question multiple pages of that question opens and going back means to navigate through all those opened pages please find a way to fix this bug.,negative
"Downgrading from 4 to 2 stars. The app is much more restrictive in the content it allows the public to read your free. Also, the share option for answers/questions has been removed from the app. Additionally, the app is now full of rubbish, sponsored answers and posts.",negative
Best app but update takes till infinity. And you cannot access the app without update. Dont know wether the problem is from google play store or from quora. I m running out of patience if something right is not done. Thanx and remain bless,negative
It a very good app love writing and reading. In their a lot of different people on it,positive
just didn't liked it's way of forcing things when you are looking for some answers. it asks for survey and favourite topics etc,negative

"the app and website and broken it doesn't show all posts within any year even when filter is set to do so. scrolling down it stops short of showing a whole year, just shows a few months or 3/4 of a year.",negative
Anything to load in this app takes too much time even if I have a good internet connection. Please solve this problem as it is irritating to see anything loading for about 10 to 15 seconds. Updated review as on 21 December 2021 - I reinstalled the app. Now it seems working fine; the content loads in about 3 seconds which is satisfactory. But I think more improvement can be made.,negative
Incredibly spamming app with notifications for random topics. Avoid it and save battery.,negative

"Notifications driving me crazy, even after turning them off, which didn't work. Uninstalling",negative
"This app has be come the most useless app i have ever seen, it takes longer time to load, the worst problem is the ads, if it manages to load, useless ad will cover the whole screen, and there is no way to cancel the ad from showing, this happens every single seconds, USELESS APP.",negative
"Horrible application, tooo slow even on the best internet speed. I loved quora so much but it has the worst interface. Please make quora user friendly and improve the application speed.",negative
"just tried it, didn't see a way to increase font size, and no Dark mode. I'll stick with Opera.",negative
A very good platform for sharing knowledge and learning from people coming from various backgrounds and fields of knowledge.,positive
"I have used quora for almost 7 years, Now they're have come up with trial and premium concept, which is crazy. Everyone express their opinions on a questions and answer platform. Charging for other opinions is not fare. I slowly lost interest in reading articles on Quora every time they say Subscribe to premium to read more... I also unnsubscribed to Quora email notifications as it has become pure commercial.",negative
App is very useful but it user experience is very poor please make a best app in Flutter language I think this app is only a web version application,negative
I am updating my review after discovering a whole bunch of.porno ads on their site. This is NOT an app that your kids should use. Yuck! I wish I could unsee all that.,negative
"Well said and correct. Additionally, there are effective .22 ammo options. High velocity hollow point, etc.",positive
"Worst app for reading & writing. Very lagy and slow even if you have the fastest internet connection.

"A useful application, I think it is similar to Reddit in use, but it is better than it to support other languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Arabic, but I think it needs to be more smooth and fast",positive
"Great app concept, decently easy to use, functions great, very little adds, this app should be 5 star. But the community on this app makes it a one star. Genuinely unusable, you ask questions unrelating to politics and people will answer your question with a politically slanted answer, why would you do this just answer my question. The political slant is always the craziest stuff too, conspiracy theory level bs that is just spewed out for no reason. Once community gets better I will rate 5 star.",negative
"So slow and laggy. Sometimes, the app enters the card automatically without touching it. Questions and answers are now so basic while you can google it easily. I think I don't need this app anymore. Sorry.",negative
"Quora is a great platform that has exposed me to a tremendous amount of knowledge, it's nice to learn new things and also nicer to get answers to your questions. Great platform.",positive
"A great education and sosial media apps. The community are great, the algorithm are at least great as it only shows me a good and interesting feed only.",positive
I was about to recommend your app coz it is full with amazing things .. but it has alot of problems in programming as it is so slow in responding .. i hope you solve these problems and i will recommend you,positive
"This app is exactly what i needed, it's one of those well organised apps that gives you a solution to every problem no matter how big or bad it might seem to be. . .",positive
I've only utilized this app. for a short time and must say kudos to the developers!!! Truly magnificent their is honestly so much to gain so much to review read about to learn. It more than 5 stars thank you so very much wow. I love it.. ‚ù§ thank you,positive
The problem of phone hanging is always faced due to both the app and the website not working properly. I think Quora app and website consumes a lot of data.,negative
Yeah it's a great app indeed because you can get tons of information from here as well as you can share what you know. I just don't like the premium version. Ugh boring.,negative
"Yes, this app can be very helpful. However it's missing something that I very much need but couldn't get. I have a lot going on rn and wanted help. Your website however and app don't allow me to post a question when it gets to long. This makes your website/app useless to me. You can have a very long answer though... Just make it to where I can explain a terrible 19 yo life story so I can get help. It would be appreciated very much because I don't know what to do. I'm sure others probably tried..",negative
1 star for concept/purpose/theme. But The app is nearly unusable. Make it like a twitter or Facebook app.,negative
"Leftist moderators, filtered and biased content as a result. Used to be good a while back.",negative
"Quora is getting worse day by day. When I started using quora I used to see very informative content on my feed. Now a days I only see memes, which pic deserve so n so likes all these stuff. Even if I click on not interested it doesn't work as next time I open the app again I see loads of memes on my feed. Very disappointed. Kindly fix this.",negative
You guys went too far greedy with that premium content. Never gona use this app. I'll just use browser with adblocker. Serves you good.,negative
My experience with this app is very important and beneficial to me as I'm illiterate I read only small phraphraphs and short stories it keeps my mind interested active intelligently I can be creative and thinking always giving my best and able to answer questions I'm interested in and educational its a great app.,positive
I haven't really had many problems with the app. I'm still getting to know my way around it as I don't use it that often but it's an ok time waster if you're bored.,positive
I can't even sign in. keep telling me there is error. what error? how am I supposed to know if you don't state what it is? I decided to uninstall it. waste of spaces waste of time,negative
Extremely laggy. Weird ads. Weird design. Only reason I use this app is because some of the questions that are asked are interesting but wven those are often times fake and made up.,negative
"Quora itself is great, but this app sucks because it requires too many extra clicks to get to the content you want, especially from emails where, when you're interested and click, it doesn't send you to the content, but a halfway point where you have to click more, etc. It would ve immensely better to show you the full text immediately, especially if you like the content a lot and click many times, it just adds up.",negative
"A great and worth while, I like the opposing views for the questions. This is good. It keeps me in the listening part of a conversation. It is good to hear what the speaker is truly saying.",positive
"Quora is very outdated in format. It is hard to navigate compared to modern social media. I dont know a single millennial or gen Zer that use it. It seems to really cater to boomers and appears to be run by them as well. There is arbitrary censorship compared to fb, ig, youtube, or twitter. Users regularly say alarmingly insulting things about spouses, children, millennials...but no speech is moderated unless it is critical of baby boomers. Answers to questions are generally unhelpful/rambling.",negative
The app is taking so much time to load the content even the internet speed is high and images also taking long time load..i have used this app before but never faced these kind of issues..i guess there is no means of using this app..bye bye quora,negative
Stalls and disables other running apps including security. I'd prefer creating a username and password vs using my other accounts.,neutral
In this new version I'm unable to see home page it's just keeps on buffering for long time. The older version was too good.,negative
"This app is by far the easiest app to use. If there is a simple in simplicity, then this is simply for you..... especially if you are computer illiterate and don't know how to navigate around a computer",positive
It is not working the texts and pictures are invisible and it is taking too much time to load the notifications some kind of issue is there I think please fix this,negative
"Maybe it's ok to use Python for the backend but you need to use the right tools for the right job instead of fanboying one language and throwing it in your every project. Python for the backend : yes. Python for the mobile : No, no and no again. It's slow as hell so I'm better off using the website. If it wasn't for the notifications I'd have uninstalled it a long time ago.",negative
"Quora used to be my favourite app, but now it's really slowwwwww, even if i open it on my computer, it's really slooww.. even just to open for the first time..",negative

This has to be my favorite app for when I'm seeking answers. very informative and seems to be direct and less confusing by overwhelming you with so many answers to choose from.,positive
"You guys don't deserve a higher star, ""0"" - ZERO would be best. I'm not an app person and prefer to see everything off the internet instead of having an app that takes up space with the possibility of ""spying"" on you. Their site forces you to download their app, what happened to freedom of choice? I know my rights and apparently the developers of this app don't.",negative
Wonderful content but learning how to navigate anything above the basics is a bit difficult.,positive
"When I redirect room chrome or Google it opens the home page instead of the question on which I clicked every time, uninstalled and now using web version",neutral
I love it but try not to get into it too much. No time as it is. I don't take care of the things I should be doing. I'm sorry but I can't make myself quit. It is addictive. I think it captures my time to much. I will just keep on reading as usual. Especially when u really can't do much anyway since I just had some surgery. Even if I didn't I would just be reading it anyway. Once u start reading the articles u r hooked. I really do like it though.,positive
"If you (developers) allow us to add photos (not the links) directly to the questions, it would be very good for us to describe our question or problem on quora.",positive
"I like it so much. I have an old accountnt on Quora, which I was using for the last 3 years but my iPhone got completely damaged, and don't know how to sign in my that account. by the way I love this app. I think every individual must have this on their phone.",positive
"Hey quora.... I think the application is crashed entrirely.... Because it is a third or forth time I'm downloading this app and this the problem hasn't gone.... Whenever I scroll, the text isn't visible completely. It is hidden behind some text that is cut with another text which is overlapping on it",negative
"This app needs more improvements, the pages uploading is very slow, the downloading of pages not possible. The theme option is not working properly.",negative
"Slow as molasses. Bloated app. Every time I click on a Quora link on Chrome Android it opens the quora app which takes ages just to load. Firm should fire all its Android devs. Uninstalling. No, I won¬¥t ""file a report to help you troubleshoot"". It should be evident by reading all the negative reviews that your app has a speed problem and should be redone from scratch. You just copy and paste the same reply to all complaints about speed. It seems to me that your app devs must have the latest greatest phones with gigs of ram. It should be your goal that your app should be speedy even in 4GB RAM Android 9 phones like the ones most of the world still have.",negative
Anyone without any experience whatsoever can answer questions which is a big problem. Also the feature of not being able to change the country to start earning money from Quora is terrible caus you can misclick and everything is fkd up.,negative
"Many years ago I was driving in the right lane of a 4-lane highway about 50 mph when a car entered from my right. I thought, ""No worries, I'll just do a quick jog into the left lane,"" which I did. I wasn't aware that BOTH of my rear tires were underinflated and when I got in the left lane and attempted to straighten out, the car began swerving back and forth as I fought to regain control. when I got stopped I was pointed in the opposite direction BUT I was still behind the steering wheel.",neutral

Horrible experience App is too slow When you click on an article white page. loads and after some time main article comes.,negative
"Every time I try writing an answer, or half of the time that I attempt to leave a comment, the app erases everything midway through typing. It's so frustrating. It makes me want to throw my ******* phone when I attempt to post an answer for the 10th time in a row. Obviously, I came straight here after the 5th time of this occurring & am still quite frustrated with it. This is the only app that I've had this issue with. Fix this, and I'll update my review.

I love the interactions and lack of annoying ads or pressure to get a membership! thank you,positive
"Quora is one of my fave go-to apps whenever I have questions in mind, bored, or when I want to entertain myself and learn at the same time. It's also a great app to interact with other people around the globe. Thanks, Quora! Keep it up.",positive
"I'm using this app for last 4 months to promote my YT CHANNEL. But every time I post anything I got blocked because of violence and hate issue. But I didn't mention any other things in my post except my channel. Recently I use my brother's account and write the same words as my own account about my YT channel and post both. My account received blocking mail as well but my brother's account didn't. It's the worst app I've ever experienced, only west of time & internet. Think before u download",negative
"Hey Quora, I think there's a problem with the app. Its not opening from last night. I don't know what the problem is but the application is just loading. Please fix it",negative
App was working fine till last month but now it takes long time to load and sometimes doesn't load at all . Tried different networks but in vain . Kindly. Fix the issue asap,negative
"Best ever app..... However, I would like to suggest a change.....Suppose we see someone's profile or we visit a space, and we like the content (answers, posts etc) and then we want that the content should get the views and upvotes for the work. But it may have so many answers or posts that it becomes very difficult to upvote all the answers and posts one-by-one. So, I think there should be options like ""UPVOTE ALL/DOWNVOTE ALL"" etc. This option will make it easier to upvote all content at once.",positive
"It's the most disgusting app in the history of internet. Constant lagging, ridiculously slow to load and repeatedly crashing is the only thing I see here.",negative
"although quora was one of my favourite sits, it started to become a place for clicha easy to digest stories, it's not what it used to be, beside.. i hate that i don't know or feel that i have control over the content i see",negative
"The amount of push notifications and emails I get from this app is ridiculous. I changed all my settings so that everything was turned off, emails and push notifications and I'm still bloody getting them. The app just doesn't want to leave me alone. I've had to uninstall it",negative
"Good App, normally. But it's a big Shame to need Quora+ to read some Answers. If you need Money, do some Advertisment or something else, but not that way!",negative
"This app is great! But this is as a suggestions ""If you can introduce dark mode for the app version please..... Thanks!",positive
"Quora has given me so many ideas and perspectives from people of all sort around the world. The last updates: i don't like it when i press the back button, it refreshes everything. That's not what i actually want. I just want to return to my last position of the home page and continue to read the other articles of interests, and then, bam, all is vanished. So annoying.",negative
Reducing the rating from 5 to 2. I've been using quora for almost 6 or 7 years now. And making it premium is not a welcoming idea. Ads are still better than paying for another subscription. The users should have an option between choosing ads or premium.,negative
"Hey Quora, the concept you people have is nice but your application isn't working correctly. The app takes so long to load. You really need to change the application",negative
"Absolutely abhorrent app, the moderators heavily censor the community banning anyone who criticizes them. It also has to be one of the buggiest, worst coded apps I have ever seen, you can click on a post and it will load one from a few pages down (oh and did I say anything about the load times?) I really hope they didn't pay their programmers much because it seems like they developed a half assed app and never fix it. They also have a membership you can buy to access content behind a paywall",negative
This is a good app it can relate to you with about any topic and if by change they don't have the topic your wanting . Then make it yourself and soon you'll have a group on your topic. You could possibly even write for them also.,positive
"quora is a good site.. But it should develop it's app and website features, sothat can get better experience.",positive

Love it!!!! Extremely informative and is helping me with my situation! Thank you for all the help!,positive

"The app's slow and full of answer seeming ads...atleast make ads of a different colour,instead of ""promoted"" mentioning Also,it has become like instagram..feed is full of images and memes ,i dont even follow and thus is consuming lot of data. Monetization concept is messed up and all the groups and spaces thing is also messed up",negative
Shows no internet connection even tho I have lots of data. Only works on wifi. Totally sucks.,negative
I think its a great app in terms of being able to hear others opinions otherwise i just downloaded it i hope it will be smooth sailing after,positive
This is one of the best educational sites ever. I should have given it 5 star but at times there are late response to questions which needs urgent response.,positive
At first this app was very interesting now it's the same thing I unsubscribe due to it was of uninterest to me now all of a sudden it is back on my phone it takes up too much space in my email please this is the second time I have tried to unsubscribe please take me off your list you are getting annoying thank you!,negative
What a poor slow and fake content in the app. I am sure this app wont be having much users lately as so many questions are just posted to get the users to answer then and create some content. Also ghe monetization by subscribing in the group is the worst feature.,negative
It was good platform..... Now to read content they are forcing to purchase subscription... Slow and Useless ü§Æüò†,negative

"This is what happens when our schools no longer teach Civics and American History. absolutely correct, the 3/5 clause is merely a.compromise over counting the census so the South would not be able to dominate the Congress through counting the slaves. they compromised and counted each slave as 3/5. If I am not mistaken this was only in force for a couple of census counts and did not go indefinitely. Without this, we would have had our own apartheid. The Constituion was a brilliant document",negative
One of the greatest intellectual platforms for getting information from each other. Somehow the platform always manages to attract some of the most curious and thoughtful individuals. Sometimes discussions reach eye opening levels of exchange. I love it.,positive
"Honestly who designed the ui of the app i mean I've been using smartphone since they came to market and still couldn't find the ask questions option and after 5 mins of searching i did find it but after i wrote my question how the heck do you add more info about the questions, i mean i had to open youtube and search for a tutorial",negative
"To me, this app proves to be very helpful. The interesting point about it is there's an authentic discussion as to any subjects raised.",positive
"I like using the Quora website. But I can't use it because it constantly tells me to download this stupid app and won't let me look at anything until I do. Then when I finally download it, all it does is show me ads. Nothing else. None of the questions load, but the ads do. I should be able to use the website instead of having to download the app.",negative
I prefer to read my tablet in landscape. This is yet another app forcing me to use portrait. Going back to the browser.,negative
The app is very slow and lagging even when I have a great internet connection and none of my apps are having issues like that. It's annoying but I do enjoy the app itself. Very useful and informative,negative
Great app... very easy to use.. and can be used in multiple devices. Very fun and yeah.. download it..,positive
You really need to work on your app. It's really laggy and not very responsive. It makes using it quite unbearable.,negative

"This is one of my favorite app! You can ask any question and many others will answer your question. Also you can choose who you would like to answer your question.

I READ MY LIFE'S STORY ON QUORA 4 YEARS AGO. YOU CAN LEARN about anything you want... ENJOY THIS APP- It's a mind blowing experiment! jrh",positive
I see alot of complaints about this app. I log strait onto Quora without an app. I didn't realize I have the app downloaded on my phone. Someone complained they can't ask or answer anything at all. I clicked on the home button and that the first option that comes up. It asks you what is your question. Log on to Quora directly like I do. I don't see where I need this app. I have zero problems logging on directly. I rate this app 5 stars. Quora and subscribers treat me right.,negative

Feels like interacting with bots. Is this entire platform mostly run by bots now? The level of weird and creepy is too darn high for me. The UI is all messed up now. Quora has run its course. I'm out.,negative
"Being totally honest as far I have used this app, I gained knowledge and experiences from ppl. I am no good at reviews but This app is very helpful for me which makes my day whenever I am Stressed. Recommended To give it a try. üôÇ",positive
The app is very poorly designed. I get that you have to place ads and push your own content too but there should be a clearer outline/separation between the answers and all the additional stuff. Opening a Quora result from a Google search is just a terrible experience! The content you're there for is 2-3 posts down. I only recently figured out that it's even there. I assumed it takes you to a random feed of things you don't care about. I like the concept of Quora but it's just a hot mess!,negative
I found Quora has helped me thru a narcissistic live in friendship. It was hard leaving. He is a sweetheart most of the time. A few years back things changed and I got tired of waiting for my best friend to come back. I ended up moving out. Quora has helped me stay out.,positive

"Deceptive ads disguised as questions and answers, lower quality answers than ever, and the good answers require a $50/y subscription.",negative
Quora is interesting. You can find some great answers here. Thumbs up there. The loading times are odd. Not extremely long but long enough to make you wonder why it takes a while to load so little sometimes If you want to answer someone's question in order to get any views or likes you must upload a picture and answer questions with the most words as possible. That is the most annoying thing about this app.,positive
The app is extremely slow keeps freezing unable to refresh and load new content. This problem has persisted in the app for over 2 years. I don't understand why the developers are taking so much time to solve this,negative

i like to read stuff on Quora because it's super informative and you learn from persons with diversity all over the world. it's amazing getting real answers to questions that you thought never made sense. I get glued in my digest digesting new info every day.,positive

"Seriously disappointing. The app is really very slow. It takes forever to load a page or select an option. I have written a post and opened another app while quora was running in the background. When i opened it back, my whole writing was gone and it didn't save in any kind of draft. I can't even write somewhere else and then copy it to quora. I searched for one space and all the questions came about it. No other topics' questions were there. There are lots of major problems with this app.",negative

"First I thought, it's a nice app with some quality information. But after being in Quora for a good time, I realised it's simply another sort of social media like FB and Twitter wherein people give their opinions mixed with their emotions. Very few answers are reliable and trustworthy and adds to knowledge. But majority are hatred spreading like FB and Twitter. So if u r already on FB and Twitter, better avoid being in here. Giving 2 stars for those writers who are logical.",negative

Keeps deleting everything I write in comment or answer boxes right after I type it. The ads/sponsored content posts are also quite annoying.,negative
Great app. One annoying thing is how it auto-refreshes and loses my position in the feed. Can we add a feature to disable this or to have new items added to the top (like LinkedIn) so that they don't mess up my current position? Give people more control over what shows up on their feed! Now I see posts (instead of answers to questions) taking over my feed. I wish I could turn that off.,negative
It's a bit annoying you can't write as much ad you'd want but otherwise it's good I'd say.,negative
"The app would be fine if not for a few critical flaws: - Can't share images. If i want to send someone an image I must reopen it in browser where I can share images from the website - No way to read a few topics simultaneously, which I can by opening them in tabs of a normal browser. Tabs would be welcome, a reading queue too. - And the main flaw: when unloaded from memory it doesn't restore the previous state as most apps! Instead it returns to start screen and we lose what we were reading!",negative
"Too cluttered. Following the question, there is an ad text, then a promoted (paid) answer, then an unrelated promoted question, and FINALLY the top answer. Too many alerts too.

"Pathetic Content distribution. Quora isn't what it was before. Never in my life I've ever took time out of my schedule to go to the PlayStore and rate an app, but Quora made me do it as I used to love the platform so much when it was actually a knowledge platform unlike Facebook, instagram or 9gag.

"Got this app just to give 1 star, hear me out. My phone has no space left and I needed to find some answers online. It forced me to make an account to read and I did. Then it asked me what I preferred to see to set up my page. My phone, being old and slow, can't handle all this and now I can't even read what I was researching on. I had to delete a app I need for this. Thank you for wasting my time, and making me make an account which will most likely receive spam emails for stuff I don't want.",negative
"Mere money fetchers. Developers don't respond to reviews. No view history,have to keep bookmarking the posts we like. Can't clear or restrict storing of our usage data, data isn't under our control unlike Google,YouTube,etc. We can't customize recommendations & make it show ONLY ones that r informative and productive to us. Instead it shows fantasies of some random ppl and unhealthy posts that wastes our time & can direct teenagers to wrong path. App has so many bugs that remain unfixed forever.",negative
I have the same issue as other users the app deletes what I write every few seconds so I can only get about 5 words down. I saw the devs response to go to a bug forum but honestly I'm too lazy for that.,negative
"With quora spaces, it has become more like Instagram feeds. Facts, pictures rather than quality answers, it's all useless and time waste. Earlier you were good but now it's all just waste of time.

"I used to use this app and platform very frequently. However, there are two things that annoy me now. Notifications and the default feed which is both irrelevant and annoying. But the deal breaker is the new requirement to have a paid subscription to view certain answers. This was just a quick and easy way to get answers. But if I have to pay, I'd rather go to a domain specific place instead with proven credentials. This has changed from a knowledge sharing platform to a commercial platform",negative
Been waiting almost an hr for app to update and still hasn't. Reviews say new update is bad. Was nothing wrong with it before. Please leave it like it was.,negative
"I love quora. it's such a great platform and it's a good place to meet new people. the reason I gave it 3 stars is because whenever I type something it just deletes it after a few seconds, which frustrates me a lot.

I ALREADY DID POST A BUG REPORT I LITERALLY MENTIONED IT",positive
"I don't like this app very much. When I first downloaded it I thought that it would be interesting, that I can read stories or share my thoughts with people who have a similar mindset.

Quora is a real human experience with none of the unwanted (social media) filler. One of the only apps where I can truly grow from as well as being able to help others. *still a few glitches but I believe some are intentional & done to protect integrity (copy/paste),positive
It's about what you'd expect the UI is user friendly for the most part with the UX being at par with other social media services (one of the better UX experiences). Still I'm new to this app and testing the shallow waters. Will update my review on further use. So far so good ‚úåÔ∏è,positive

"It's not a fair place for freedom of speech. The few control the voice of the many. The app is slow ""it lags"" and it leaves words out and or letters and correcting it can be challenging. People are mean and they like to bully you if they don't like your opinions. The same questions get asked over and over and the app will even show the Google answer if you reply üòÇ it's silly. It has a find a friend app that looks scary and creepy perfect for pedophiles and a dating connect with call girls.",negative
"The content is good, but actually doing stuff is a pain. I have so many problems with just answering questions: everytime I'm writing an answer and have to switch between apps, when I come back it doesn't allow me to continue writing so I have to save my draft and go back into it. Recently it's just randomly skipped a line when I start writing and now it's started clearing my entire answer when I'm writing it. It freezes alot too",negative

"Quora is a great place to read about topics that are sometimes hard to find elsewhere. Plus, you can directly ask any question you can think of and get an answer from varying viewpoints that usually answer without the extra fluff in an online article. The topics covered are diverse and you can create a subject to discuss when not found. It's a good place to expand and flex your knowledge. Quora helps provide info by email that is like minded to your searches on their site. Great app.",positive

If I'm typing an answer and switch apps for any reason then it locks me out of finishing my answer. I have to save it, reload it, which takes FOREVER to do, then eventually it might let me finish. Today I can't post answers. It just says ""Oops! Try again later."". So frustrating. Fix this app. Please. I pay for it, it should work.",negative

I dislike this practice and will document it accordingly Edit 02/27/2022: forced downloads are gone but comments/replies are deleted MID WRITING on the website.

To be honest I don't know what I would do without Quora. I have been sitting back and reading posts since March 2017 actually and it has shed light on a lot of confusion and given things names that I didn't know existed until I was presented with them face to face.

The Best App Ever üòç. every one should spend time using quora. it is worth to use the app and time that spending here will teach you many things. it's not worth it anymore :),positive
I've been using quora for a long time. My only problem with the place is it's algorithm. Just upvote or show interest in one topic and next time the whole feed becomes repetitive with same type of content. It becomes really annoying.,negative
That happens to me all the time with my children and top it up with my husband too. I'm surprised I haven't reached the mental house yet. I have 3 adult children. then in top of all this I'm still able to handle my younger sister's drama she's 42 and my mom's attention seeking and pride to deal with. God knows how I do it. Almost like every two weeks each of them takes turns. Then I have 2 adult cats who go into rebellious mode every 2 weeks as well.,negative

"I've been frustrated with the text editor on mobile for a while now. It's always had an issue that if you took an incoming call while you were texting, you would be unable to continue writing when you came back; it would freeze. Now, the app is unusable if you try to write content, so I'm finally going to delete the app. Whenever you try to type in an answer, it will just auto delete everything and make you start all over again. I hire mobile developers all the time; this is unacceptable!",negative
"overall app is good but whenever we minimise application or reopen app same post not visible due to which not able to read old 2-3 years old post of same person. one more thing, app takes slightly longer time to be view post while scrolling in comparison to website. smooth fast scrolling. both features are interrelated, solve anyone or both. regards",neutral
I had a great experience using this app until it became so slow to use. Its the only issue I face that it's very slow,negative
Horrible. It is better using the mobile website than the app as it is not optimuzed for opening external links. A page took almost 3 minutes to open and then the app crashed. Stick to the browser based quora.,negative
There is a real problem with taking part in discussions because the app keeps freezing. I often have to reboot or go to another tablet. It's frustrating when you're in the middle of making a comment!,negative
"Lately, when typing an answer to a question, the app deletes what I have painstakingly typed on the tiny virtual keyboard of my phone after about 100 characters. Most questions are looking for more detailed answers than what could be in a Tweet. Please fix and update üôè",negative
"Thank you for this tip. Funny thing is I normally have a baking stone on the bottom rack, but removed it this time because I wanted the oven to heat to the correct temperature. I should have just left the baking stone there after all it is ""baking stone""!",positive
"I really like the Quora community and think the app is good...but not great. For example I have no idea how to get to answers other than the most highly voted one. It looks I can, but clicking that item is useless. The UX could really use some work. I'd hate to have to use the app a lot because the UX with a browser is so much better.",negative
"I was in the middle of writing my answer which took me minutes by the hours. Like, Adding a Image in mobile was a struggle unlike back then. I was able to add a photo without having to draft my answer, But ever since now i had to. Cause if i try to put a photo on my answer, The app will freeze and i need to exit and draft it again.

App interface isn't very appealing and handy while writing and editing answers..,negative
Impossibly inefficient. Simple functions require uninstalling and reinstalling the application. I am sick of this. Fix it or I and other users will simply give up using Quora,negative

"Quora is interesting, but website and App are not user friendly. My major issue is each time I open the app I see a different page. I was editing a comment, put the app in background to answer a text and when I reentered the app using the task viewer, my response was gone and I couldn't even find the question I was commenting on. Likewise if the answer has 11k upvotes and you want to answer as well, good luck with anyone ever seeing your answer. I couldn't even find it after I posted.",negative

"Its finding the opinionated answers to all sorts of questions and simply knowing were not alone and simply want and need to know! Its a nice way to get not one opinion but many so a person can side with are weigh out and thin out any answers to every question are unresolved puzzling theorys -we,us,you & i may have are simply put' theirs so many right and wrong answers for all of us its more geared to exspand our minds & with undersranding thar we can agree to disagree the answers were seekin",positive

"You know, I installed the app and was expecting relevant and significant information however it showed most of explicit and mature sexual content despite my turning it off in the settings. I had to uninstall it soon as I have kids at home. Control the adult sexual content and you get five stars. Over all the app is okay except this nuisance. Fix it.",negative
"I used to enjoy Quora quite a bit, but since it has become impossible to comment, I would really love to punch Quora in the throat. There's nothing more frustrating than being 5 or 6 sentences into a post, only to have them vanish into thin air. As far as I'm aware, this has been going on for 2¬Ω weeks. Stop me if I'm wrong, but it might be wise to address the issue of not being able to post questions or answers in an app that was specifically made for asking and answering questions? ü§î",negative

I've gotten really sick of social media like Instagram. It feels so competitive. Quora is a really nice app for when you want some downtime but don't want all that.,negative
sometimes information is not completed and I didn't agree but it helps a lot better than nothing .now I can try to ask a lot that I want to know.,neutral
Lags a lot! Get used to waiting at least 10 seconds after scrolling before trying to click a question or article. Or you will end up looking at something else. That is if it doesn't glitch while you scroll and click anyway. Other than that is a good app. Lots of interesting things.,neutral
"Great content, when it works. Unfortunately, this is a super unstable crApp. I want to pay for the premium services but if I can't even manage to enter my payment details on the device I'd be using it with 99% of the time? Makes it quite a tough call. It's a heavy resource hogging app that screws up constantly on any of the last five years or so of flagship Qualcomm chip phones. Type a big answer? Better copy it a lot, because eventually the app will crash & your draft won't be saved. $50/yr?!?",negative
"Network strength and speed is good still App is not working properly , take so much time In loading Also, due to quora+, you can't access more answers now.",negative
The app is very slow and at times it is unresponsive and bugs most often. And you can't copy and paste contents in the app. Only the web version let's you do this. Consider making this feature possible for the app.,negative
"This is why I had to turn off notifications. Well first let me say I really like how people can communicate on a emotional level and learn about others ideas and tap into other minds some (Dark) But, that's all good too.

"I've been a long-time Answer contributor & I've been having the same problem David Kramer has been having: I start to write an Answer, & then the Answer disappears or self-deletes. Same with Comments. I was using Android 11 but upgraded to Android 12. Had the problem before the upgrade. Still have it. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one having these issues w/Quora. I notice others don't seem to have these bugs. Are you phasing out Android support in favor of iPhones only? Or are we just lucky?",neutral
It's good app but I've tried to add topics to answer infinite times and still struggle with it. This makes my experience worse,negative
"Much improved functionality, UI. Content is like always great, useful.",positive

"I love the app but the mobile version is annoying. If i click on comments, it doesnt show me some at a time but all 150(an example) and they dont load up all at once so it's really challenging for me when I'm trying to get to the next post. Also, the entire app needs to be revised to become more mobile user friendly.",negative
I much enjoy reading every day. sometimes too much content and can't keep up but enjoy,positive
You should work on typing experience . This app freezes many times whenever I comment in someone post or send message,negative
I love using the Quora site its my favorite regarding writing blogs. It works better on an android phone instead of i phone in my opinion because it tends to crash & freeze up in my experience.,positive
I like having access to experts. It makes life easier and less unknowns means less wasted time. Less wasted time means more is accomplished with less effort and with less mistakes. Less mistakes means less waste. If you keep going in this way you see how man is in a cyclical pattern of growth and prosperity....which means some detractor(s) as not been accounted for... lol : ),positive
"Why is it blanking out my answers before I can hit post? Unless I type really fast and hit post it blanks my requested answers and puts a blank response in my drafts folder? These are the answers people have asked me, I rarely check the oddball sections bc people ask "" can a person eat a whole onion raw?"" Or "" can a 8th grader own a bazooka if their parent buys it for them?""",negative

What is it ? üò°. After updating 2 times within past 10 days it is not loading . What's the purpose of updating then ? I think for the very 1st time any app is trying to degrade itself using 7 mb deta. Very much disappointed nd dissatisfied. It was a very knowledgeable app. Ur previous version will be missed . Doesn't deserve 1star even.,negative
It has greatly improved my life. This is the best app in my life. I don't like some aspects This app needs further development. It takes time to open And it works a lot slower,positive

"Excellent tool for formulating opinions after absorbing multiple other opinions & facts. Quora developers must think everyone has the hindsight to bookmark something ( or everything) you may want to re-read in the future? Puzzling design.

I think they should extend the stars and make it like 10 and I will rate them all. thanks.",positive
"My experience with my Councellor Janani Reddy was awesome. Initially before I joined yocket and till I met my counselor i was clueless but she guided me in each and every steps plus she tracked my progress and helped me to get admit in almost 8 colleges and also successful filed my visa within the target date. Also the finance team was pretty good. They helped me to get loan from bank. Overall Janani team including editor , visa and finance was excellent.",positive
I love it. So much to learn. In my opinion Quora is the best when it comes to knowledge. It takes time to find particular subjects that someone may be interested in but if unsuccessful just ask the question. Wait and you'll get your answer and it will impress you. That's just my experience.,positive
"Quora in the moment, always the here and now. Hear and wow, see the value of every contribution on a whole new level. Quora does I.T. Classic quantification. Clarify classic epic monumentality. Every prospectus enabling new insights. Investing time here offers benefits to all who share the experience. Enjoy!",positive
Used to love this app back in the day but now there are just repetitive meme answers which doesn't answer the questions at all. Also it seems like quora has become a place for right wingers vs left wingers. The quora moderation needs to throw these people out from quora (the memers and the political lefties and righties). Also the app has become a lot slower than what it used to be. Please take quora back to its former glory üôè.,negative
"Full of bug, the app closes on its own, the article thread takes 10 seconds longer to open, do I need to explain more?",negative
"I learn from others queries. Sometimes I get a chuckle from the unwritten parts of the answer, but reading Quora is part of my morning routine.",positive
"Quora provides the platform, support, inspiration, information, and a plethora of resources all in one convenient app. But more than a platform, Quota's spaces provide a voice and listening ears. The inspiration comes from real like minded people who's only agenda is to grow, contribute, and belong. whatever your niche, there is place for you. I could go on but I couldn't give Quora's developers and contributors justice . This is only the beginning of my trajectory with Quora. I'm excited.",positive
"it's very educative and helps to teach more about some things you don't know through the answers. it is a good source to get information and opinion. but i cant seem to open the app on my laptop and this is rally frustrating. i can only use it on my phone which doesn't allow me to navigate. please i request that the quora team will help resolve this issue, so that i can use my laptop to view it better.",neutral
"Everything is perfect! My issue with the app is the lag, it hangs, lags and fails to display what you type. Sometimes when you scroll down the page it just hangs/delays. It delays too much. The app is fantastic, it's just the lagging issues I'm having a problem with which makes me give it a 2 star instead of 5.",negative
Why don't you fix bugs üò†üò† wanna earn or not ? üòÇ Too slow and lags verymuch niether able to upvote nor comment Also it's not a bug it's....,negative
"pathetic and greedy , so buggy . The platform is good , their managers are not. Reducing rating to 1 Worst app ever... When Reading a question if suddenly I minimise the app and then open it, it restarts and the answer is lost.",negative
My experience with this app has been fantastic. I've learnt a lot from the questions and answers which are the main feature there. It has indeed added to my knowledge.,positive
Well its a really helpful app..lots of knowledge to gain lots of people to help but its extremely slow and damn sometimes stops working...It starts lagging and responds too late sometimes it takes forever to load something...pls fix that!!! Aslo the ads and feed are too irrelevant,negative
"Used to be very informative earlier, but now it's more of a story, anecdote and meme sharing platform.",neutral
"This app rarely works. Attempting to open questions from my emailed digest usually results in ""Something went wrong. We are looking into it. Please try again in a few minutes."". It's never fixed in a few minutes and if I copy the link from the email and just open in a web browser it works every time. I installed the app for dark mode support, but with this failure ratio it's best to just uninstall and use Chrome.",negative
It's kind of okay...but it could be better ...if we could see the accounts those have viewed our posts...and the page layouts and style and features needs to b updated to go with the current time being !! Otherwise it's a great platform..!! Hope u'll work on it...üôÇüôÉüôÉ,positive
Latest update keeps hanging and screen goes blank !! Also crashes sometimes,negative
"Amazing. Please create a category if we want to save answers from other users. Like Instagram, we can save with our self-named categories.",positive

Interesting app. Lot's of strange and interesting stories. Different degrees of culture and art.,positive

"I still haven't even been able to use the app yet because I've been stuck on the ""choose your interests"" page. A lot of it just repeats and repeats and there's no need for most of the options. I've quiet literally been on this for 3 hours. Plus, it starts lagging really bad fairly soon.",negative
I love this app but it sucks a lot of data Even more than Instagram and twitter combined and it loads everything I prefer that it should only load only when u want to post üòäüòäit's a cool app but these are my problems.,negative
It's a wonderful app but the only thing is it's taking too much time to load when I want to switch different pages... Apart from that it's a great platform for sharing knowledge.. I wish you to fix this problem . Thank you.,positive
"full of bots or ""humans"" asking stupid questions that can be answered elsewhere instantly. Some ""humans"" have asked over 20,000 questions. Those ""humans"" are merely content creators for the site, not actual information seeking genuine answer requesting humans. Some questions are just for sparking debate, some are just like Reddit and looking for validation and don't fit in with what the platform was intended for.",negative
"love this platform. it is very addictive and innocent. my only gripe is the adverts - too many, and they look like the articles. the app is not anything special.",positive
"The app always freezes, you might have found a good post then all of a sudden you can't scroll up, down or click. It's super frustrating. Then there's the comment function... When you click on the comments they do come up however, for example there's like 300 comments then you click the comment function the comments don't have a limit it's like they're endless so if you can put a function where if you want to read more comments there's a click more after a few comments.",negative
I downloaded the app for the first time. And I'm totally disappointed. Every time I scroll or hit a button the app jams and gets stuck. Couldn't even enter settings menu or comments section. The app eventually stopped working. Seems to be completely unusable. Went back to the web version but it doesn't work there anymore. You guys need to optimize and make the app lighter.,negative
fabulous piece of knowledgeable trend. I love Quora... We can learn so much and know so many. Thank you for all our stories and knowledge..,positive
This thing is confusing and don't get nothing from it.. Im trying my best to cancel this subscription..,negative
"I opened this app after a year or two, n' got spammed with random ""pity stories"" and options to ""subscribe"" to ""Quora +"". I uninstalled the app after viewing multiple 'racially motivated posts' similar to the ""post"" that had a pic of ""black girl"" saving a ""white boy"" from ""the hot sun"". Apparently this kid was waiting for a ride under a shaded tree, and a """"black family"""" came to the rescue of him from being kidnapped and having a heat stroke. No thanks, have fun with your racial monetization.",negative
good app to get answers for pretty much everything.. but i am giving it 3 stars because the application is hanging like hell... please fix it... other than this there is no issues.,negative
I get answers to so many things. It gives you ideas about most issues and nagging questions. It's been an amazing experience so far.,positive

"I have been using this app for a long. But it has been stopped working from last 2 days. I have switched my internet connection from wifi to mobile data. Besides, I have reinstalled it, but didn't work. Could you please fix the issue?",negative
Outstanding app everyone should replace it with Facebook WhatsApp to add values in their life. I personally enjoy using this and I get all kind of quarries resolved also information and motivation as well. Thank you QUORA team.,positive
"The app is good but is a bit slow. One problem that I am facing from the past few months is that I am unable to upvote or downvote, the option is just not working. Whenever I click on the upvote tab an upvote is added and suddenly it goes away and no upvote is added. I request the devloper to kindly check the reason behind it and suggest a solution.",negative
"Absolutely üíØ not a user friendly app. ANYTIME I try to write out an answer, if I leave to go grab a link or picture, I then cannot get the writing cursor back anywhere on the screen. I also wanted to use a link from my clipboard, but it won't let me use that either. The cursor always disappears if I ever leave then come back to my answer. Same thing with commenting. It's horrible.",negative
Lots of great user content. Very insightful and relatable. Wonderful to read new perspectives.,positive
"It has a few glitches, like when i try to place an image or paste something in my answer, it just freezes and whatever i was trying to put there doesnt show up. And it also suggests me like 5 yr old questions and I end up answering them before looking at the date...",negative
This is the most hypocritical app I have ever worked on it requires questions and answers and then you are restricted because you ask a question not according to their guidelines when you have a vocabulary they do not have the vocabulary to answer I've never met such a crooked app for questions and answers I've never seen so much restrictions since second grade it is just a lamp every time it's upgraded it finally tells more people that they have less freedom of speech because of disputes,negative
Very good and a real treasure of knowledge. Could you please provide some features that can be accessed offline? Like bookmarks.,positive
Great and interesting app. So educative and informative. Entertainment should please be considered,positive
"I honestly thought that I was the only one going through this. It breaks my heart to learn that there are many other moms that are in the same situation as I am. After my ex husband and I divorced after twenty years of marriage, my boys and I remained very close. A little over a year ago my oldest son blocked me from his Facebook and instragram accounts. I have no idea why they have quit talking to me. My oldest son has told me to F... off!! I cry myself to sleep every night!!",negative
"Many questions are troll or malicious. The quality of pushed questions is really low. Many bad questions are repeated again and again, which waste readers and responders time. I don't see a solution out of this vicious cycle. Good luck.",negative
"I really love this app, has so many insightful news and articles written by people from all over the world, which seems beneficial for me as someone who is in the world of corporate communications...",positive
As most of us quickly come to realize Google has this simple rule they follow.they give the impression that if they have to drop every thing to give you the time of assistance that they figure will take the time needed to assist you then they will have to do the same for next person needing assistance.weve all learnt to accept that.how many apps have you installed from go o gle store then quickly Uninstaller the app because it didn't work.,negative
"This response was incredibly balanced in intellect and compassion and logic. It provided a logical response just in case for now, the heart/emotions has shut down. It really makes you think because you answered the question without judgement and really explained how something may feel incredibly intense right now but it doesn't always at all times! We can improve our circumstances we may have to work harder but in that journey, also find joy its there I promise it's there.",positive
Great Application Thank You So much for creating such type of application. I will connect with many people virtually. I solve my doubt easily Thank You so much again. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíñ,positive
"I'm grateful for this app and I'm not sure exactly how I signed up for it two years ago but I do enjoy getting the emails and being able to relate to other people's stories. Sometimes it's a laugh and sometimes it's serious and bizarre, but there's always something you can learn.",positive
it's an amazing app for youth . it's better than those social media apps where you only waste your time but here you can learn and also help others it's fun to know this,positive
"Overall, good. Still kinda slow when opening new questions, but anyways... There's one little thing. You give us the chance to translate answers, but you don't let us save the pictures in that answer. That way I have to make a screenshot, crop the image and import it into the app. Why don't you make this easier for us...?",negative
I'm using 150mbs internet speed still this apps running slow . When i use this app with my mobile internet then this doesn't work properly hang a lot I was thinking my internet slow but when i change app to youtube the video playing smoothly while this app only written content can't take load . I don't know whats wrong with your app optimization. I will uninstall quora app right now . Your website work fine kindly remove your app from app store ‚úÖ,negative
I think it's a wonderful platform to voice your opinion freely on. I don't think it's a plot to keep us from talking about really important issues like the price of GAS lately or anything like INFLATION!,positive
Much of the content is great but many web based links (email digest/ internet searches) are dead/ not to linked to app based articles; frustrating to find articles u could see on the web but then can't read when forced to read in the app. And if you briefly have to leave the app it then redirects to the home page & wont remember the article you were reading. Key word searches dont work reliably since many articles of similar content are not linked to the same key words or topics.,negative
"I appreciate helping people and getting help, it's amazing and indeed needfully most times!",positive
"I love reading and responding to what people say, and whenever I respond I try to be as thoughtful of their situation as I can, but whenever I'm on the app and I try to like things it automatically removes like. And yes I am signed in.",positive
I find this to be a great app. I personally find it fun to ask questions and give answers to questions. Havent noticed any apps or bugs so far. Really happy with my experience.,positive

"Quora is really great platform. But damn, you guys the one who is developing the app, man you screwed it up! Its so slow to search something from quora that i use google ""search query + quora"" and get result faster than searching from your own app.",negative
"Used be better. Now app becomes slow, constantly buffering no matter internet connection strengthwise, topics not loading for along time... app becomes plain bad. Dont download. Not to mention trolls and misinformers swamping inside.",negative
"Recently anytime I go to post a question it just loads forever, & even when it was working, anytime I'm editing something exit the app & come back, it's frozen, & have to force close the app & lose everything I was writing!! üò° I'm I'm never going to get a premium membership if you can't get the app to work, PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!",negative

Issue with browser quora links. Opening quora post links from browsers in mobile app doesn't work.,negative
I have to press the back arrow in app about 10 times before it works. Clicking on most questions will open them up in a new page but sometimes it just doesn't and has the comments underneath. Then there is no way to get past it. Use the browser or better yet don't use quora.,negative
"A very good platform, to get knowledge, pen down your thoughts, learn multiple things based on your requirement and a lot more",positive
"I am not great with technology but slowly learning, the best app to date that has helped promptly and respectfully. Keep it up",positive
The app is very slow and good at failing. Is there any way you can make it browse faster? The first tap into the app has just failed.,negative
"My comments didn't appear on the answer or the bubble comment icon. But if I look at my edits it says my comments are there. PLUS, the app is soo laggy, I wished that the second I tap a link or button it would respond just like hovering a link on pc and show that I have tapped it. Instead, it would take 3 seconds to open the link. So unintuitive.",negative
"I had a hard time finding and turning off notifications. When I had this app before I enjoyed it except the constant nagging notifications. They became overwhelming. But couldn't turn them off, so I had to turn off the app. I still get notifications every day like 4 times a day! Sometimes more!!! So I'm hoping that things are different and I can turn off the notifications!! Content is good. Just don't send notifications!!!!",negative
"I love the Quora app. I appreciate the Developers for making this app and wanted to say thank you because it's really helpful. I highly recommend this app is your are looking for insight relationships, general life advice and Soo much more! check it out! it's free and really nice to know others have gone through the same hardships or yo u can contribute and help others. so it's really cool. thanks again. :)",positive

"What the heck?? I am doing a lot of things in chrome, watching videos on youtube etc and I am not having any kind of problem. But after downloading the app for the 1st time the app shows, ""No Internet connection. Please connect and try again later"". I don't understand why this is happening. Although my mobile data is fine and if I connect to wifi the same thing is showing...",negative
Overall I have a pretty positive opinion on the app but the major problem that I have is that once I click on my digest and then leave or close the app I am unable to open it again if this were to be fixed it would truly wortht of 5 stars,negative
Quora is an app which has answer to all of the questions a person can have. But the problem I faced recently is that the Quora team deleted my answer to a question without even letting me know and without any valid reason. Every answer we write takes time and effort. So it would be great if the Quora team let me know why.,negative
"It's totally American biassed, I'm British not American, and you can't even mention wars that America lost without getting moderated. I mentioned Pearl Harbour, didn't say ha you lost, I didn't say that, and got moderated. They can't even spell English. The writers use appalling grammar and formatting, it's a rubbish site. Pro Trump, pro America, the the rest of the world doesn't exist to them except to start wars with and lose. Most of the questions are automated and harvested using script.",negative
I just deleted over 1600 emails that were still unopened since March. An intense amount of emails. Nope. Uninstall.,negative
"I enjoy this app because it makes you meet and interact with different people all over the world you never met before. If you ask a question here, People will always be willing to answer your questions. If you are carrying out a research i think quora is the best place people can help you find solution to those life questions you seek to find answers to. It's an educative app. It broadens your knowledge",positive
"I have read alot of people's complaints in the reviews, After a couple of years, I haven't seen any of the issues, that alot of have brought up, In 2001, I took a company buyout, and started volunteering, and counciling at various MHMR centers, to learn how what people need to feel wanted and accepted, when they go thru a unwanted episode, and warms my heart for them to calm down, with my heart and mind for me to be what they need at that very critical time. I will never give up helping them.",neutral
The most slow and soo high adversities app they don't give knowledge or make answer they only show a lots of adds the wrost app I use till time they need to convert their app in a advertising app and only show advertising if some install it they answer of questions and show 100 time adds instead of one answer,negative
There is no option to change the language. Not a user friendly app. Worst experience,negative
"Amazing app, but it very often lags. Like one your selecting topics it does not select the topic, giving answers get very hard to do, and when you try to click something. It's very annoying so please fix it.",negative
"Very fun, interesting and informative! One of the best apps out there, honestly.",positive
"To be honest, i really like this platform, but it is such a shame this platform has some toxic people. I really hope the toxicity don't turned as bad as twitter (some side of twitter is actually good). But on other hand, this site is very good at learning and teaching other people's experience or tips. Also, the feed recommendation is so much better than youtube and much more understanding what people wanted to see.",negative
"Your comments get censored left and right, everything flagged and moderated because even though it was fully true and factual, someone didn't like it. Garbage app. I keep it just to laugh at occasionally but I would never consider anything from quora as credible for anything, it takes less than 5 minutes of looking through the site to realize that's just not something you're going to get on here. It's a freak show, but people do love the occasional freak show.",negative
Very slow app. Keep hanging up. I write one answer and in the middle it would hang up. Its very slow.,negative
"I like the app. It performs its functions well, however the app performance is glitchy at some instances. I try to enter one answer at the bottom, but it takes to the answer above it. This is a big issue for me",positive
"A well-functioning app with a clean, straightforward UI. Love it.",positive
The app is very slow and takes so much time to load. Sometimes it wasn't even open properly.,negative
"The content is or should be pretty great. But I can't seem to find a getting started guide or so. I never know if I answer a question, search for an answer or comment. I am not sure I understand how the groups work and so on. It's not very intuitive. And the most annoying thing are the constant push notifications and I have not found if or where they can be switched off. Those notifications were what made me eventually uninstall.",negative
Why this app is not working in landscape mode... I would prefer chrome reading. App is not optimized for my tablet.,negative
"This was one of my favourite apps since past few years but now my feed is bombarded with right wing propaganda and and unnecessarily hateful political posts even though I have never shown any interest nor participated in such topics or discussions to be recommended these topics. Quora was once a platform for deep, insightful and thought provoking answers and knowledge, now it is just platform for hate and political propaganda.",negative

There is one issue in this app. The issue is when I read the story and i get the some words which I don't know then I go to translate to other app then after 4 to 5 sec. I come back to quora to read that story which I was reading But suddenly that story disappears like the app again refresh. Everytime it happens,negative
"The app is great overall, with some annoying features. I still use the website even after downloading the app. On the website, I can read a post without having to go to another page, whereas in the app the ""read more"" button opens a new page. This is annoying, because on the web version I can simply scroll down after reading a post, while in the app I have to click on the back button to move on to another post. Please add the read on the same page functionality to the app.",positive
Quota has tons of information you didn't know you wanted. It also gives you so many choices as to the type of information you'll receive. I love it!,positive

Makes you cycle through fifty different menus to disable email and push notifications. Very annoying tactic used by apps like these to apprehend as much of our attention as possible. They could have easily added a disable all notifications button. They new what they were doing.,negative
"It's BNBR rules has been more realistic but still far from perfect. But since I am using this app for a long time and since I am a big hearted guy, I am going to give full marks.

"love this. it has been an outlet, a resource, a support group, a reminder of who I am meant to be.

The only thingnis I feel it can be overwhelming at times and difficult to navigate through.",positive
The website is better. Too many bugs. Sleeping the phone breaks the composer. Choosing a credential often hangs. The app is unusable.,negative

Quora is authentic and factual info. No gutter press or subjectivity! I've always found reliable material here. Thanks Team.,positive

Sad because I really felt like this was one of the most legit apps online with real peopke giving their true experiences and telling there point of view and how they solved the problem or least giving advice to help .now freezes cant read half of answers and oh my gosh dont get me started on how hard it is to reply or answer someones question.why even have the option for us to answer or reply if its impossible to even pull the screen up to even attempt it.DO OVER please.,negative
"Got a new phone and kind of forgot about having Quora. So I downloaded it and all my info, people I was following ect are all gone upon the re-download. Any help would be greatly appreciated...",negative
App is completely broken. Leave the app and it freezes. Try to close a message and it freezes. Try to leave or edit a message and the keyboard doesn't show up. When posting the window will randomly shrink sometimes so you can't do anything. It doesn't show you all the questions you asked. Pretty much all you can do is read and make sure not to let your phone sleep or leave the app or it freezes. Broken all the way around.,negative
Home page Interface can be improved way more.. Just a request to make it more easy to use and simply improving the feed. Every post on feed seems like a cheap advertisement.,negative
"I have changed my ratings from 4 to 1 . There are 3 below main reasons (1) Now you can't use it in chrome browser, it will force you to install app. (2) Loading time increased. Earlier it was very smooth to use. (3)Lot's of Ad",negative

"If you change to a different tab while writing a comment, or try to add an image - what it takes to have a credible conversation with citations - the app breaks what you have tried to write.

"I would rate this app 5 stars, it really is very good but there us just one little problem. There should be a separate section for the question the app gives us which are based on our interests and a separate one for the questions which people actually ask and another separate one for the questions which hasn't yet been answered. One more thing, it is a bit slow but that's fine.",positive
Let me tell you why I gave this app just one star. This is the most useless app I have ever seen for Youtubers. When I tried to login with my Google Account then it showed me to fix errors with the name. This was the reason why I was unable to join with my Google Account. At last I tried to join with phone number and I joined also. I join this app with a purpose so that I can promote my YouTube videos. No person used to check my answer on this Quora. I never got subscribers but useless emails.,negative
"Email inbox spammed for the rest of your life, it doesn't matter how often you'll mark them as spam, next time you open your email you'll have multiple emails from quora about things it thinks you want.

"Banned for NO REASON, no warning, no appeal, no response from support. I had only attempted to use it maybe 3 times ever. Without any warning or notification I was banned from answering and asking questions. Not even a message telling me that was the case. Not a political person or a troll of any kind.

"I enjoy quora for what it is a collection of human knowledge and insight. it is the human equivalent of Wikipedia, but tacked on top is simply the ability to reach out with a personal issue and getting a discussion of sorts going. In my experience most of the people on here are genuine in that they seem to want to spread positive change in others lives. (or wish to answer if a weak bullet could kill a man...)",positive
"The app was a great success few years ago But now I only see screenshots of memes being shared in the feed. Quora, don't be Facebook and keep your content clean we don't need another Facebook or Instagram.",negative
"The app is okay except for using a lot of resources for no apparent reason. Should be better now that I restricted its usage of battery and memory. When this is installed, set it to the lowest possible setting for resources, not the other way around. Have some respect for people and devices that download your application! I finally decided to look at the battery usage after the second time I picked up my phone after not using it for a few hours, it was hot as hell and battery only charged 20%",neutral

Pay to see certain answers and feed full of memes. The worst part is that Quora actually promotes them even though you didn't subscribed to those pages. It's really sad to see Quora loose it's integrity over the past few years.,negative
"When i click (open in the app) when i am one the browser version, it gets me to the play store which is annoying",negative

This is one of the best apps I ever had really good in story's that would touch your heart good on words and there's lots of motivation stories too,positive
Sluggish App. Sometimes doesn't even load notifications. Also setup some settings for notifications. It never pings if someone replies to our question or comment.,negative

"They are now censoring post and comments. I posted asking why they are censoring post and they deleted the question after I had multiple people answering. The app is full of bots asking similar questions, I'm not sure how many humans actually use the app. Not to mention the half naked girl profiles which auto up vote your post. The team behind the app are more focused on censorship than they are building a good app, the functionality is bad, it's not smooth like a modern app, it feels like 2007",negative

The quality of the answers are degrading now. Most of the time it's kind of spam or a biased propoganda answer. Hard to find genuine information on the quora. Now I tried to refrain myself from clicking on quora to check any information.,negative
When i start using it i liked it alot. My home page full of good articles to read but after update there's only screenshots to read and see. I did not even followed that pages.,positive
"Both Quora Plus and not being able to browse the Web version without having an unclosable popup are disgusting business practises. The concept of quora isn't unique but is successful and well executed, but these follow up updates are terrible.",negative
Every question I read I have to manually turn off related answers so I don't inadvertently read an answer for a completely different question with similar keywords. Your algorithm is awful. Please just make it a setting that remembers your preference.,negative
"Love the idea behind this app,but it is often hard to access and i need to hide it in order to faculty other stuff online!!

"It depends on the subject. Sometimes I reply; however, I'm often more interested in general responses as a barometer of my own thoughts and feelings. During this pandemic and so many groups to which I belong still closed, my own logic & pragmatism often bores me.

This is another good reason for dipping into Quora board. I seldom notice most ads.",neutral
"Absorbing, Exquisite, informative and what I personally consider to be its best feature is the absence of misleading and biased media and I don't need to name some, it's just from people to people and I witnessed some really funny discussions such as ""why don't we, human race, live without borders that separate us and have only one government and one president?"" Which shows how free and open-minded, and in fairness nuts, the users of this app are. You should give it a shot Highly recommend itüëå",positive

"I enjoy Quora far more than Reddit. The access to insights and stats I find to be invaluable. Moreover, I feel reddit has been maintaining a terrible codebase? The experience is all over the place. I think they'd be better off rewriting the application, barring some algorithms. Even then, post engagement works weirdly on reddit. I think Quora has nailed it with community moderation. Looking forward to engaging with it more.",positive
"This app is cool, but PLEASE let people delete their questions. I put my real age in a question and I couldn't delete it, nor edit it.

what an experience seriously you have experts in fields that you would have no way of finding without extensive research giving you unconditional answers or maybe slightly less than so but still excellent.,positive
The site is amazing and great. The app is utter garbage. If you tab out or your phone screen turns off you can no longer finish a message and must save the draft and close it and come back in.,negative
good platform if you want to know something just follow or choose that particular field and you get so much knowledge from experienced persons...,positive

Doctors are required to be on their feet and without even toiet breaks for entirely too long! It's criminal to demand so much and doctor suicide is a hushed up epidemic with almost nobody who cares.

"Actually, Quora is the best when it comes to answering questions that I'm struggling with I always get my questions answered through Quora links on Google, and this idea came into my mind to download the app which will help me a lot since everything I'm going through has already been solved by someone else who's going through the same situation, gone through it, or has the answer for it",positive

Doesn't filter topics that include showing dead bodies and more explicit graphic things.,negative
"Used to like Quora a lot. Now it's full of memes and pictures that bring down your spirit and posts that play on emotions and beg for likes. The problem is that even after you ask Quora to show you less of that content, you get even more of it and from the same channels.",negative
The performance and loading times have slightly improved and it hangs less often. Kudos Edit: The upvote button has been fixed. Seems it was a server side issue.,positive

"Not a review of the app but Quora. It used be a decent platform to discuss and share ideas. The veracity and quality of the material was never A grade but it was readable and believable.

Though there are still some good writers but the amount of bot written and Google translate generated content has quadrupled. Really disappointed and shame on the creators of Quora.",negative

Deleting before (I hope) I start having the spam problems many have reported in their reviews.",negative
Whose bright idea was it to put post options at the top? It was best the way it was before. Nobody decides what they want to do with the post BEFORE they've read it. Hate when changes are made for the sake of making a change and not because it improves the experience. Just as stupid as some of the TOS.,negative
"The comment section doesn't stop loading until it gets you to the very last one of it. This makes it hard to scroll down to other posts.

This is an interesting forum. Very divergent ideas and some good discussions although there are often errors and one has to be very careful and not believe everything that's written. Also don't even bother to follow any story that is sponsored as it will be trash.,positive

It takes toooo much time to load. App needs optimization. It is little bit laggy and slow. It doesn't not support photo paste by clipboard. And when answering question if we minimize app then That answer gets stuck. Means it hang. Then we have to save answer as draft and again answer it later. Quora needs to fix as soon as possible.

quora has fallen to the dark side more than actually holesom answers. vast majority seem to be fantasy replies or fetish or joke related. I used to love quora when it was vastly more popular and moderated better. people could ask a question and get real answers and suggestions. I don't know maybe I am getting older and realizing I don't accept manure replies anymore.,negative
Not a great viewing experience on tablets or other large screen devices. This app feels like just a scaled up version of the app for phones. There are huge black bars on the left and right side of the app window and that's a lot of wasted space on a large screen device like a tablet. It should be optimized so that the viewing experience on a large screen is like what you get when visiting Quora on a desktop browser.,negative
"I hate being forced out of the middle of reading something interesting only because it's on browser, either at the start or never, not halfway through.

Quora is really amazing, very. Maybe the only problem is that people who love porn are disadvantaged, I'm not even sure you can send videos on Quora.

Didn't use it very long but the app is slightly below average.. Realized in short order this platform runs on the garbage in garbage out model with a propensity for coddling right-leaning wingnuts. I've seen the poor answers on Google and gave it a whirl but don't make the same mistake as I did. It's a waste of time and is nothing but a place to spread conspiracy theories straight from the Q playbook.,negative
"Bingo, that was nicely worded. That pretty much sums it up and That directly speaks about how My marriage ended. In the beginning theyre all bubble gum smiles and candy kisses.

Pls resolve this issue as soon as possible.,neutral
"Amazing app you can get lost in for hours. It's really packed with adds and confusing to navigate at first, but once you figure out how it works, the information you find is endless.

I love the app but I have two problems with it that you people seriously need to fix. I am very visually impaired to the point I am legally blind. Every other app that I have on my phone allows me to either set it to dark mode or to set it to operating system default which is also dark mode the other thing that I wish you would do like other apps that are reading type apps do which is allow me to make the font bigger so that I can read it easier. Not everyone has perfect eyes.,negative

"Very insightful. I'm not being egotistical when I say this describes me accurately. I have always been very curious and asked many questions, but I thought it was because I was picking up information more slowly than those I was working with.

I like that the permissions are not as invasive as some other apps. I like that it's encrypted too.

Quora must enable the views count of a writer's answer because that's one of the key motivator for a person to keep up the good work and yes! Comments do help and upvotes do too but not making a writer able to see the no of views his answer has garnered will reduce their interest in writing more. Please enable that.

"The questions and answers make for interesting reading and cover a huge range of subjects. The frustrating thing is the app is glitchy. One major fault that I've reported several times but just been given lip service about is that the app refuses to play embedded videos.

Twice I've reported it and been told it would be fixed on the next update, but it wasn't.",negative

"Although there is SOME valuable info here, and a very engaged community, Quora is targeted by trolls who post really offensive ""leading"" racist/alt-right sounding/bad-faith questions that are just ways of poking the bear.

"Hey, in case you were wondering if the glitchy issues that were widely reported back in 2020 were still a thing - YEP, they are. To format the text after the fact, you basically get one shot before it gets hung up on editing and you have to hit Save Draft, back out, then go back in again. Otherwise, you won't even get a scrollbar. On long posts, this can take hours longer, with a higher risk of your draft not actually saving correctly, like it says it does, but actually disappears.

Great platform to gather knowledge and share what we learnt. Thank you Quora for your great service. Your app is very smart in its performance. All the best for you Quora.....Highly recommended. Without Quora no Smartphone will not be smart enough.,positive
"there's a pretty severe issue with being able to post replies out the gate. if that improves, maybe my rating will, but at the time it asked me for one I've been able to post two and it has failed on three more.",negative
"Very interesting, and frank, answers to everyday situations. I like the direct answers, sometimes rebuking the person, for their incorrect actions. They tell it like it is!",positive
When I scroll a little 'deep' the app becomes unresponsive and my phone freezes. I don't face such problem in other apps.,negative
"Quora is a great App for a majority of reasons like self help, educating yourself on many subjects, passing time w/,favorite interests or hobbies , connecting w/people & helping others with answers. Plenty of genres ( spaces) to follow. I love it.",positive
"Whenever I write an answer or coent and include a picture from gallery, it doesn't get uploaded immediately and cursor disappears as well. I have to close and save draft and reopen it to continue writing. If I have to add 10 pictures, I'll have to save and reopen 11 times. It's annoying. Also, I cannot add GIFs.",negative
"A polite request... Bring Themes . (interface) Color categories. I say this because my eyes wander all over trying to find, even, my own comments haha I'm sure it's not exclusively to me. Thank you",positive
"Hey Quora devs, all users that currently have the dark theme on would agree that the loading screen should change its color according to the theme, since no one wants sore eyes... That's why they chose the dark theme in the first place. Hopefully, this would be considered, thanks.",neutral
Best platform for QnA i liked the interface but only thing origin of questions and answers should be clear to everyone. also quora space and person has two different following options it should be one way for recognition of expertise.,positive
"Quora needs to allow the app to rotate. If I'm not mistaken, it used to, but not anymore. I don't own a phone, only a 10"" tablet, so it would be nice to use Quora in landscape mode. Also, as a result of a recent update, the font and everything displayed in the app is now tiny- unreadable. But when I change my display font size in my tablet settings, I need to set it to the very largest to get the Quora font to display normally..... then all the other apps display giant font- just as unusable.",negative
"I would say that Quora is an advanced version of instagram. But it's much soothing than insta tho. I have been using Quora before I even got my phoneüòÇ. Overall, I would say it is a very appropriate app since u can have both fun and gaining knowledge day by day :)",positive
It's really helpful to me. But I think the user interface is not so easy. Please work on it.,positive
I really like the app it's really informational but I think if I were the developer I would allow pictures with the questions if people prefer because it would allow context,positive
"Most of the pictures are all blanks anad unable to read the posts. Frankly, i had no other choice but to deactivate my account",negative
Amazing app just love it i am getting addicted to it perfect app but there is a bug when i am writing and open other app and come back it doesn't work I have to save it to the draft and then start completing it,negative

"I have found some some of my favourite reading materials in Quora. I believe the definition of knowledge is not 'knowing things', it's rather a bunch of questions of which One is seeking answers to. The idea being, the more you learn the more questions pops up and hence, the learning, the search never stops. And Quora is one of the best places to do so, specially it's being curated to find answers to any kind of question no matter how esoteric it is.",positive
"The Best Tool App to learn and share lot of General knowledge, Health and wealth related tips. It's totally Simply superb App",positive

Very interesting technical analysis. Well explained. Good job to the developers of the site/ app,positive
"I don't like it. It's confusing for me to use and so many rules. Can't read this without applying, can't post that without applying. And the constant ads everywhere. No. Bye. Uninstalled",negative
great site to seek advice and validation but too much click bait and deceptive layouts to guide you toward paid sponsors and once away from what you were trying to read it can be unnecessarily cumbersome to get navigate back often forcing another search query to get back.,negative
"Please add a description feature by which we can add description to a question. I love quota so much, and I want it to be a faster app then Facebook.",positive

In my case everything was made available, good ielts and International work experience, they promised that they will get AIPP for my case else refund money. years are already gone, they dont answer any phone calls and neither made any refunds.. A real fraudulent and cheaters whose sales team will lure you and tell you everything to get payment done",negative
"You can't browse without participating. I love the idea of the app, but you're asked to give qualifications that lead users to constantly ask you questions. Quite often they could find the answers on Google. But once you answer one, there's dozens more. You can't just use the app to browse and learn things from others, without being nagged again and again.",neutral
"it has a lot of interesting stuff about most subjects I am learning, the good the.bad and many other fields as well",positive
The reading topics are vast and the variety of content not only informative by relevant individuals but down right addictive.,positive
"Quora has been, and obviously is, the most reliable app (website) that gives you a reliable answer of your unsolved question and unresolved issue. Quora application also gives a user-friendly interface to its consumers. most recommended for everyone.",positive
"Majority of the questions you search up don't have a proper answer, it's always either 80 pages of promotion for some scam product or people who genuinely have no knowledge of a topic.",negative
"Quora has been a great platform for me, he teaches me a lot about life, moment, mindset and also building one's self.",positive
"If possible, I would give this app a zero star review, the app is bugging (sometimes taking up to 30 minutes to load) and when I finally realised my own self worth and decided to delete the app, it said my password was incorrect, (even though I checked 3 times and it actually WAS the correct one). Still trying to delete this terrible app and I hope no one ever uses it again.",negative
Cant even see anything - When I open up my keyboard to write a comment it doesn't show my text unless I select all and try to see what's being written. Really intimidating.,negative
"I totally agree. I know that homeless people don't want to go to the places that the government has for them, but why not try the programs? To me, it's better than sleeping in the woods, and you won't have to worry about the bears!",neutral
Quora is a good place to get answers from people related to a particular field. The interface is very cool.,positive
"It was a good app till the far right fascists found it and now just inundate the app with conspiracies and screeching that everything, including them stubbing their toe today, is communism.",negative
"Good app, right intentions and very useful. Unfortunately the app has been polluted with 'questions' like ""What screenshot requires 2.49 thousand upvotes"", and shows a picture of a meme. That isn't a serious question, is it? That's all I see on my home page now, I dislike Quora for that.",negative
"Just imagine having Alzheimer's and Parkinson's at the same time. Now you can have this experience with the brain deadest app- Quora. Despite it being just a forum, it's a bloatware that is unusable unless you have 1Tbps internet. It takes it minutes to load a paragraph of text, with the 'Go back' arrow convulsingly blinking and sometimes the whole loading process getting canceled.",negative
This app is literally ASK anything & SAY anything. 18+ for most of the :) spaces/groups. This app is way better than Facebook! Everything from recipes to nudity. Whatever & however you like or need.,positive

I can edit even though with or without using in app so thanks. A lot more to say is I found as welcome by using this or internet usage no dictionary as what I'd known as simple conversation in english language the same as Filipinos explanation in 'Ingles People' to elaborate the meaning from tagalog or easily understand to whom knowingly using the Nat'l. language of other culture & translation maybe? as Filipino & American Mutual Defense Board & not always available ü§ù üíëbut still single as me?,positive

"I liked this app a lot! It's very nice to see people answering questions that are often relatable and would be agreeable. And It's interesting reading people's opinions about the topic that they were having. It also answers most of my questions as I am a curious introvert. And I totally would recommend this to everyone, trust me you will like it.",positive
"As a lover of learning and sharing interesting information with others, Quora's three component format intrigues me greatly. There are endless possibilities to explore curiosities by posing thought-provoking questions. There's also the invitation to those with unique insight to share relevant expertise/experience as answers to the posted questions. And there's a third, somewhat passive component, where users may, if they choose, join Quora and just learn from the Q&A exchanges.",positive
"Well, sometimes I just want to see other people's perspectives on some issues. This app fortunately helps me with it. Like it!",positive
"These articles that I read throughout the day are the only thing that has finally explained to me what has been going on for the last 28 years of my life! I truly thought I was going insane, and that I was alone. I wouldn't have made it without your informative Q & A's to provide me with more knowledge about this sickness. I share these articles to help protect other innocents. I plan on continuing to be an avid reader and participant, as my journey ahead is long.",negative
"Can be difficult to move about the app I've been so busy & shortcuts knowing them all, studying everything about the app so I could use it like a pro I'd definitely give it 5 Stars! I have a Temporary Learning Disability (believe it or not) however, knowing how to use Quora good makes it BETTER4 & only gives businesses every extra knowledgeable chance. Students also will be off the ground & running after learning & using this app!",positive
The range of topics is large and one can keep going through more responses as per one's interest. I got lot of input for sharing a fresh write-up on care givers and care for care givers from another source.,positive
"It used to be an app for intelligent people but now it is full of political correctness and has sunk to the level of just social media. It is very ""spammy"", hard to uninstall and enables hacking and scamming, I found.",negative
I love coming into another world with each topic I read. it's great to have a place to relate & give advise with other people who have interest in being involved.,positive
this form of social media proves to be more worthy of acknowledgement. it is a way for us to learn and connect with/each other.,positive
No benefit but forced to download to rate but putting up barriers to use in browser. Same as all others. No one wants all these useless apps taking up space. FFS.,negative
"It's a good app but gosh there are some serious flaws. Whenever I write an answer, the moment I switch apps to do research or download a picture, the app will break down and I have to save draft and edit again. On the topic of pictures, sometimes, they just don't show up and if I try to upload a picture the same will happen and I need to save draft again. Also, off topic, WHY DO I NEED TO PAY TO SEE AN ANSWER FOR A QUESTION I ASKED MYSELF?! That's just bull...",negative
"Interesting app with countless varying insights from people all over the world - which, as a concept on its own, is extremely useful for learning and empathising with others outside your usual circle. Give it a try - you might just become addicted! (One thing that could change is some functions & UI to perfect the overall use, but I enjoy my time on this app even with minor inconveniences.) Love it!",positive

"Cannot accidentally hit the home button and the app let me continue to type. I have to save it as a draft and reopen my response in app, which is impetuous and 5000% unnecessary. Why would the keyboard just not work because I did something else with my phone? I doubt it's on purpose, but it is reality and apps owned by a reputable entity should have more pride in their product so people like me have nothing to complain about.",negative
"Can be a good source of info. Quora has done a good job of keeping the üí© out, which is impressive and commendable.",positive
Very unorganized app. Finding your way around this app is so difficult I leave the so most of the time unaccomplished. This app needs a complete overhaul. 1) Can't find replies and posts made. 2) can't reply. 3) can't leave a message your responding to. 4) can't his or block posts or individual posts from showing up. There are just so many things won't with this app. I wish someone else bus this app and changes it.,negative
"spot on... but the British sent those convoys knowing they had little chance but the risk of an Axis airbase in Malta, given the very short range of most military offensive planes that early in the war made it tremendously vital & it was worth it to stop Rommel's supplies.

Edit 2022: The App is even worse than before. It will no longer allow me to post pics when I try to give out answers in my paragraphs.

It's interesting if you'd like to share your opinion and read what others are thinking about. But some of the questions really make absolutely no sense or the question that they're asking has such an obvious answer it shouldn't be asked.

"I used to be a frequent user of the app. Quora has top trustworthy content from experts but developers have really destroyed functionality of their service by making it overly complicated and confusing to read a simple question and answer.

I can't even find a second answer to a question.",negative

On top of that it won't do bulleted number lists anymore. It tries, but then erases the numbers I type. This app desperately needs an update. It hasn't always been so buggy.

Zero posts from the topics I follow in the home feed, only posts from topics I don't follow and don't want to see at all. What's the point of following a topic when I have to search for the topic every time I want to see posts in it? Plus, the Q&A layout is insanely confusing, the worst UX I've seen on any app so far.

Update as of 1/20/23: Still riddled with technical glitches and annoying bugs.",negative
The app adds nothing to the experience of using Quora other than adverts. I find it easier and more pleasant to access Quora through my browser instead- where I don't see any ads. There's a particularly annoying bug where extra lines get inserted automatically at the end of my answer while I'm typing- as if I'm pressing the Return key. The app is also slow and difficult to navigate compared with the website. So that's why I've uninstalled it- it's garbage.,negative

This platform has a lot of nerve trying to charge us for content when we provide it. Often wading through the many ads that adorn its pages.

I do not know if it is human or an algorithm ( my money is on an algorithm) that deals post as hate or not but needs drastic work. If you report something as hate speech, spam, or anything else they are just moved to the end. People are free to deal out hatred as long as they avoid certain words. Moderators consistently ban people who post facts but not hate or spam.",negative

"Quora is a somewhat good platform for asking questions and receiving answers. however it has become politicized, primarily from the political right, as a platform for asking insincere, rhetorical questions, that are intended to state a point of view (typically, a narrow-minded, ignorant point of view), rather than seeking genuine answers. Quora could put a stop to this, but they don't, thus allowing their platform to become a vector for misinformation. I suspect their motivation is money.",negative

I am pretty even when it comes to which app is better between Quora and Reddit but with Quora I do enjoy the interactions a bit better that I have with other people. Reddit does have a huge point though over Quora with the avatar feature which is awesome! üòé,positive
Sadly changed my review from 5 to 1 star. This app used to be neutral and informative. It is now so corrupted and invasive with political Ukrainian/American propaganda and notifications. It is not Neutral source of information anymore. They censor the truth promoting only US interests. The information is not realiable and therefore the app is useless.,negative
"This app is one of the best for gaining knowledge this app give us a lot of knowledge and it also help us for being a perfect person and the story's that we in this app are amazing story's and be seeing a overall performance of this app, this application diserves 5 stars‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåüüåü.",positive
"Once upon a time, it used to be a good platform for knowledge sharing. However, the quality is degraded since last few months. There is plethora of fake profiles, which start arguing and abusing on any answer. Once you block them, you get notifications that your answers are collapsed. Obviously, these answers are reported. Last evening, 30 of my answers were reported and immediately collapsed. The reason is very vague and unreasonable. Time to quit Quora. üôèüôè",negative
it was a great experience. Each and every one explained topics clearly understand online classes very best plat form,positive
The scrolling lags. Have been using this app since 2014 haven't had so much of scrolling issues. It has made so unusable.,negative
Quite buggy when it comes to quoting responses etc. Also formatting is lacking. There is much room for improvement. If you consider being active you are better pc using pc for Quora.,negative
"I've been using quora through a browser for as long as I can remember. I was searching up why advertisements don't work on me since I can't focus and why it takes me so long to respond to someone talkimg to me. Found great answers saying I should train my focus. I immideately spotted the ""view in app"" button. In conclusion: this app is an advertisement for itself-designed to answer specific questions and pick out the most helpful answers. Awesome!",neutral
I searched up a question about adhd I wont say nothing else besides that but anyway when i searched it up about adhd I came across a story about and I really liked it you might think I'm weird for liking a story about adhd but I dont care cause you dont know what story it was about I know you know it was about adhd but agh!

"Hard to like, updates slowly and I don't have all freaking day to wait for it to update, my internet is fast and my phone expensive do it's not that It has great potential, but waiting for 14l5 minutes for my feed to update, or for my comments to show up (when it doesn't update and I wait to see if my comment/response was received at all) You're professionals, successful and wealthy, you can do better than annoy the hell out of people",negative
I like this app becoz I love reading than watching about that topic on YouTube . Overall app is good but I have some issue that whenever we tap on the link of answer and when we approach to this then the real answer which was showing in the link is below 4-5 answers which is a problem.

I am not able to give less than 1 star so I am providing 1 star but consider it as -1 because it's totally worst app no use of it and specially if you installed it for earning than imideately uninstall they will not provide a single rupee for your work...I just putting here my experience,negative

"Previously, I used to love reading answers on Quora. But after some changes like default ""All Related"" option in the answers section and the Quora+ subscription to read an answer, I lost my interest in this. Not only me, but many users complain about this daily.",negative
It was one of my favorite app untill they banned my account for no reason and no prior information. Despite raising the concern they haven't provided me any feedback yet neither they have unbanned my account. Have never experienced such thing with any other app. Seems they are least bothered for their subscribers.,negative
"Browser version is much better than the app, especially in terms of reading stories. Please make the app more like the browser version and it would be perfect.",positive
"Great place of learning new things, massive Verity of groups to choose from and great for interacting with people and learning different sides of a story.",positive
"Always lags and didn't work even in the high speed internet. Loads and get stuck at some point ....... Scrolling lags everytime ......i always have to go back to run the app properly üòïüòï....... Needs a lot of optimisation (MOTO G31 , ANDROID 12)",negative
"Honestly love the concept of quora but that app is extremely lacking. When I am making an answer or a question but need to switch to a different app for info, the whole entire question page becomes glitched. I am unable to type and need to refresh entire page and go back to edit my question/answer. The ""enter"" tab is gives too much space and when you are looking for a question, they overwhelm you with related questions vs just giving you your answer. Good concept but the site/app lacking. 2/10",negative
"Hi, happy spring to everyone at Quora. Thank you for a helpful and useful app which is one of my favorite go to sites for info based on the experiences of others. To me, everybody who has shared advice seems to be generous with his or her knowledge and wisdom. Each person is like a breath of fresh air. I completely enjoy reading Quora.",positive
"It was a great forum for Q&A. However, now it is filled with meaningless baised answers. The only question I get encountered everyday is ""what is your salary? Are you satisfied with it?"". Answering it in an other way in a way more motivated could be better. Instead PPL started to showoff. I suggest quora to monitor on the content and questions frequently.",negative
"The latest update has disappointed me though the earlier one was also annoying, in earlier versions it use to take 5-10 mins to load a page but now it just takes 2 seconds and you get to see ""Try again"". And what to say about notifications once they start to ping it just goes on for about 15-20 notifications. These issues must be resolved otherwise the app will lose its user base and subscribers.",negative
In this app I can't delete my Gmail account it say something went wrong please wait a moment. And app send me lots of email in day I want to Stop it,negative

"Notifications seem to be broken. Which makes it really hard to have conversations with other users. I suggest having Snapchat, or another chat option if you actually want to hold a conversation with people successfully.",negative
"Just use a browser. Excruciatingly slow, buggy, and counterintuitive. Automatic formatting always causes problems. I can indent my own paragraphs, rather than crash. Hyperlink format will hijack the whole post. Takes all day to load every page because of all the bells and whistles, and if you try to use them you might crash. The buttons are too small, I didn't mean to press that! Instead of dismissing a notification I wait while it loads a thread I don't need so I can back up and start over.",negative
"This site is one of my favorites. I don't have a chance to be in the different groups I'd like to. Love the "" get paid"" invitations. Just haven't accepted yet. Great site for learning, lots of different groups and options. The Administrator's in groups give great feedback. An all around app for those with varying interests.",positive

"Use Quora on browser! I‚ù§Ô∏èQuora, but hate the app. Switch apps, even quickly - sometimes you can't switch right back - highly likely you will not return where you were. Worse even, we're you in the middle of writing a long and thoughtful answer? Gone! But maybe you saved it as draft? Too bad you're not in the same place - if only you knew the URL, or Quora had a history feature. You can't even have this app as alternative, click Q-link from email, it hijacks the option to open in browser!",negative
Was 4 stars now 2 ish... Had the app for years but don't care to use it. Just to messy with to many related links but not the answer I need to my question. I get you want to keep me on the app but tooo many distractions and its not even ads are the problem.,negative

This is Top most worst app because It has baned my ID [Account] without any reason. When my 1st was baned without any reason I complain on the give website.

"The app is now like a and adult community that full of fake stories and nudity pictures, if I disable that filter I get bo more access to an actual safe content, so it is annoying, I keep blocked pages but it keep showing me some unrelated suggestions between related one, even with communities that should be safe to browse normally you will see a lot of nudes and sexual content, a lot of spam directs you to unsafe places, also it is spamming you with notification even after disabling it.",negative
"There is alot of people or bots asking the same question over and over but the down to earth, everyday people with the same problems as you may want answers to are in abundance here.

"It's amazing. Quora has been my favourite social media app of all time and the reason is pretty straightforward, there is much more sensible and useful but also entertaining content on Quora. Data science mechanism is very well built, only the content I like to see is shown on feed. Overall it's a wonderful app. Hats off to the developers .",positive

"The application is very nice, but it works slowly sometimes. Please fix the problem, thank you",positive
It's alright. Most people just use Chat bots to answer questions though which is pretty disappointing and offers very little variety in answers.,negative

Good for sharing the insights But develporers should improve something and making the things more clearly like ui and they shoul add some feature and remove some !!,neutral
"Quora has really gone downhill. Once a long time ago, it was a place to share knowledge, ask questions, and learn. Now it has the greed of Facebook, and it's clear throughout the experience that this is just another corporation existing to maximize profits. There is no moderation of posts to keep this place knowledge focused. Your app homepage will be filled with memes like this was Reddit. It is really sad to see how downhill Quora has gone, and they don't seem to care.",negative
"This is what I wrote back in 2016 and a 5 star rating ""Quora has been the best app. I have learned so much from real experts all the way to people from different countries, customs, and cultures, as well as the most unbelievable experiences people have come across their lives. There is always something interesting to read"" Now, ads monetization and the algorithm killed Quora. Bye Quora, I missed you a long time ago.",positive

Account / Nav bar disappears at bottom, have to scroll all the way up to get it back again. 300+ MB RAM usage, for displaying 95% majority text? It's gone. Won't ever be back.

It wasn't clear enough and the confusion that was always confusing everything got worse and worse I didn't understand so I can't send it on Lost,negative
"The app was useless and it was very difficult to delete my account. There is some good content, but if you sign up you will be inundated with garbage. It became unbearable after a few weeks.",negative
I like this app because you learn a lot of things and there aren't bombarding you with ads. The ads are just a small texts with a very small description. The adds seems like is for what you really interested in. Seems like there are no stupid adds that will scam you. You can hide if you want. I like it because when you enter you fell like you are free to explore and without distractions. A small problem is for the most people this app make it feel difficult to navigate but you will eazy get it.,positive
"Quora is an utterly monumental dumpster fire. Worse than the amount of factually incorrect answers there are, is the way it presents comment threads to answers. There is one answer I recently had a disagreement with another individual on, not educated in the subject despite answering it. If I go to the thread from my notifications, it shows me the theead. If I go to it from my bookmark, that thread isn't even there. It says 473 comments, but even viewing all collapsed ones it only shows 461 max.",negative

Wouldn't let me continue to read what I wanted to unless I followed 5 topics of interests. I should be able to check out your platform without you trying to build data on me. Give people an option to answer that question later or opt not to answer the question at all.,negative

"It was my favorite app. However, for a year, I noticed that we can't see all the answers on certain questions. And it keeps showing up related questions. It is really irritating and I waited for months that maybe quora fix it and let us see only answers for certain questions we're looking for,but no.I mean the app loses its purpose in this case.

"(1) Question reading halfway disappears on locking mobile screen. (2) And the same question I was reading earlier never appear, even after intensive searching on the subject.

Very sorry to lose the Quora site.",negative
"Horrible to navigate. They will bombard you with constant requests. Algorithm program is horrible without filters, if you write a single word, you get questions about that single word. If you pass on questions, you still get more of the same questions over and over again. Users can be verbally aggressive, spread hate, best to block comments. The site censors. Sad, because it can be a good source of information and opinions. Bombards you with emails. App freezes up constantly.",negative
"My experience with Quora has been less than optimal. In 2020, I posted an answer to the question ""how do you convert 690 feet per minute into inches"" [There are 12 inches in a foot, so if you times 12 inches(1 foot) by 690 feet, 12‚Ä≥ x 690‚Ä≤ = 8,280‚Ä≥(inches) You get 8,280 inches per minute instead of 690 feet per minute.

Another problem I have with Quora is how people can actually post the most racist things ever.

Garbage buggy app for a toxic garbage website that seems to be designed to keep people trapped in algorithm loops. An echo chamber for people that don't want change but feed off the destruction of eachother. It breeds idiots while trying to pretend to be intelligent. And even if there are some intelligent people on the website is a combination of naive intelligence and evil ignorance. Quora itself needs to be put down. But sadly like most social media there's too many Bots farming add currency.,negative

"Quora is attached to an old email address I no longer have access to and won't allow me to delete or deactivate that account without a password I no longer have and won't let me create a new password without confirming it on that old email.

It's nice to visit to see what people think but because of the echo chamber deal it seems to push even seemingly wrong comments.

"Once a Good Platform(even i gave a 5‚≠ê) now becoming a Garbage. Stupid Posts which only contains Screenshots of memes posted on other social media platforms. Hate Speech, Bad Words and Vulgar Languages, No Moderation. No action taken on fake accounts and reports made.",negative
"The app works fine, but Quora is overrun by trolls. Sincere questions are few and far between, and most of those could be better answered by any available search engine. Moderation on the site is ineffective and it doesn't appear that management has any interest in curbing the trolls.",negative
This app is very helpful and it supports another A.I browser called Poe .It gives answers instantly but has a limited number of questions for a day and if we want to ask more than we have to subscribe Poe. But however it is a good app essential for students.,positive

Cool I love reading the stories. You're awesome this is a great app. Just sounds giving me a bunch of ads and spam and I'll be okay with you.,positive
"Good app however the questions are getting ridiculous, lots of 'which screenshot/picture deserve a million views or likes' and so on - boring and not educational or informative in the least.",negative
"This site in my opinion should be completely SHUT DOWN. It focuses on the Negative. Opens a forum for Bashing Faiths with which people may tend to disagree with. This is done totally disrespectfully, and therefore not wanted on my Mobile Device. I have found that the majority of the negative feedback is regarding a kind Christian Group: Jehovah's Witnesses. This type of thing is totally unnecessary and completely offensive to the greatest degree!! It is basically one-sided and definitely. üëéüëé",negative
"It's fun to use, but full of scammers. They're easy to spot after a while, but when you report them nothing happens. Maybe Quora wants their ""number of users"" to look good so they welcome scammers. Never saw an app with so many. They also use terrible software to pick out ""dirty"" images, its less accurate than flipping a coin.",negative
"I really liked using app for different reviews or info but recently noticed they are only contributing their one sided political views. You know the type. It wasn't like that before, why do it now? I don't care if you're Democrat or Republican, keep it hidden, keep it out of the articles you write because as a reader I can smell your one-sided views. Make it balanced views, both sides. It turns me off when a company does that, its not normal. Or better yet don't do the political thing.",negative
"The app is only slightly, negligibly better than using a good browser. But, the app does not allow photos to be downloaded, unlike a browser. Deal-breaker. Secondly, if I want to see the same, slightly changed answer plagiarized from an AI chatbot, I'll go straight to such a bot. The amount of cold robotic AI answers are killing Quora. That's why I'm uninstalling.",negative
"There's no record of last post I was reading. This is frustrating to see, that such an amazing platform lacks such basic feature.",negative
"I find a lot of things that interest me, but there are technical errors. Trying to leave a comment is one of them. My security software does not like Quora because if safety issues. I've decided to uninstall it.",negative
"Conceptually ok, execution is bad. In today's day and age when privacy and ownership of personal information is so valued, the app takes that away from you. If you have posted anything personal and you want to delete it later then you can't, quora won't help you either like a psychopath, they don't care if the information posted is harmful in the long run or you want off. Moreover, news feed is filled with graphic violent imagery you have no choice of avoiding either as soon as you open app",negative
This is great for information sharing. I love to write & some stuff is appreciated. I find answers to questions that I never thought to ask too. Very interesting. Some areas are annoying though. It's not the app. It's people. I don't look at Twitter X because I don't need the aggravation. So I slowed down here as well.,positive

"Quora is a fantastic platform that I wholeheartedly endorse and encourage others to join. However, there is one aspect that I find displeasing‚Äîsome individuals who join Quora display a lack of consideration and even selfishness. Despite being incredibly busy, I make an effort to dedicate my time and energy to answering questions posed by members. Sadly, when I ask my own questions or request answers from others or groups, they do not always cooperate, treating it as if it's none of their concern",positive

"This app is slowly circling the drain (along with its parent site). Errors frequently pop up when trying to share within the app, with no apparent updates fixing that issue. If you want to write something, leave the app to do something else, then come back, good luck picking up where you left off. Worst of all, though, is the site itself -- after depleting its moderation team, it's become a safe haven for all manner of unsavory types. I still use it, but I'm not sure how much longer.",negative
Forced subscription to mail is the most disgusting experience. Even though Qoura provides a lot of information it sends so many mails to our inbox without having subscribed to it.

I would have had a great experience if you had not blocked my question with a stupid answer. The slite miss spelled would does not make a lot of difference. Something is wrong with Google Assistant.

It's a perfect app but i leave one star because this app consist of many ads every press comes with ad. That irritating. Otherwise it's a good app,negative
"First: I installed the app because the website can never play video links on phone browsers. The app gets one star because it also can't play videos so can't manage to justify it's existence.
